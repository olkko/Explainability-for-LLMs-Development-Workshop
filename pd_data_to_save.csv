Data sources and searches
An investigator (IYK) and an information
specialist from the University Health Network library services independently
performed the literature search. Studies were identified using Ovid MEDLINE
(1986â€“2012), EMBASE (inception to January 2012) Cochrane Central Registry of
Controlled Trials (inception to 2012) and CINAHL (inception to 2012). The
following keywords, alone or in combination, with mapping of term to subject
heading were used in the database search: â€œsclerodermaâ€, â€œsystemic sclerosisâ€,
â€œlung transplantationâ€, â€œpulmonary fibrosisâ€, and â€œpulmonary hypertensionâ€. No
language, publication date or publication status restrictions were imposed. The
results of the 2 independent searches were compared to ensure completeness.
Study selection
Titles and abstracts were screened to identify
studies reporting survival post-lung transplantation in SSc patients. Studies
were included if they reported 1) human SSc patients (classified as SSc using
the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria [19], or
physician-based diagnosis), 2) lung transplantation (single lung, double lung
or heart lung transplantation), and 3) reported survival as an outcome. The
primary outcome for this study was death from all causes. Studies were

We aimed to identify and appraise the up-to date scientific literature about the effect of non-pharmacological interventions delivered by non-physician HPs to prevent and manage osteoporotic fracture in high-risk adults, age 50 years or more. High risk of osteoporotic fracture was categorised using BMD values for low bone mass (osteopenia) and osteoporosis specified by WHO,15 and/or short-term probability of fracture. Searches were based on two critieria: (1) adultsâ‰¥50 years of age at high risk of primary or secondary osteoporotic fracture and (2) interventions delivered by non-physician HPs to prevent and manage osteoporotic fractures. Interventions included diagnostic procedures to identify risk of falling, therapeutic approaches (eg, structured exercise, education, falls prevention programmes) and implementation strategies. Key outcomes were fractures and falls (where the accepted definition of a fall was an unexpected event in which the participants come to rest on the ground, floor or lower level18). High risk of falling and change in BMD were included as surrogate end points.

Inclusion criteria were determined a priori.
 Studies were required to assess gait characteristics between footwear in terms
of spatial-temporal variables, kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity and
behaviour. Participants were to be healthy and able to ambulate independently
such that their gait pattern was considered normal and would not influence
comparisons between footwear conditions. They could be of any age group and
either gender to observe any differences throughout age and include data from
both males and females to draw comparisons from if possible. Overground walking
and treadmill walking were both deemed acceptable in order to access all
studies analysing barefoot walking gait characteristics. Studies of
observational cross-sectional design were included to allow for review of the
comparison between footwear conditions wear inclusive of socks, open-toe
footwear such as sandals or flip-flops and slippers. Observational comparative
studies were deemed suitable if they were comparing between habitually
barefoot, who have grown up and continue to live without wearing shoes, and
habitually shod, who wear shoes on a day-to-day basis, populations to determine
changes which occur over long term use with or without shoes. Case-control
studies were also included providing the control group fitted the participant
criteria and data was available for conclusions to be drawn solely from this
group with regard to footwear intervention. If both groups fitted the
participant criteria, then providing that data was available these were
included and comparisons were focussed on the separate group's response to the
footwear intervention rather than the comparisons between groups. 
 Studies were excluded if the footwear included
any interventions aside from the features included in the original footwear
design such as separate insoles or orthotics. Any studies involving
participants who required a walking aid to ambulate were also excluded along
with participants who had a known previous or current gait disorder or
condition that could influence their gait (unless the study also consists of a
control group through which analysis can be drawn from). Studies were excluded
if they used running, unless a walking test was also completed from which
analysis could be solely focussed. Literature other than peer-reviewed journal

Studies concerning the use of a cadaver model to explore cardiac arrest pathophysiology or to assess the effectiveness of a new CPR method, as well as studies using HCMs to simulate cardiac arrest for learning and/or teaching goals, were eligible for this systematic review. Cadaver models used for any fields other than CPR or cardiac arrest and studies on animals were excluded. Cadaver models that could be included in this study were identified through a systematic literature review (Fig. 1). It was conducted in accordance with current guidelines on systematic literature reviews and it complied with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.18 Search strategies and data extraction Studies were identified through electronic databases. The following key words were used: â€œheart arrestâ€, â€œcardiac arrestâ€, â€œcardiopulmonary resuscitationâ€, â€œcadaverâ€. Only articles with the full text available in English or French were selected. No type of document restriction was applied and no methodology filters were used. All studies published until February 2019 were eligible for inclusion. This search was applied to Medline and adapted to Embase, Current Contents and Pascal electronic databases. We also searched the grey literature (Open SIGLE). The precise research approach for identifying potential eligible studies is described in Appendix A.One author (HD) conducted the literature search with the help of a professional librarian (VD) to produce a database of references. Finally, a secondary search was conducted by scanning the reference lists of the original articles retrieved. Two review authors (HD, GD) independently and blindly screened the titles and abstracts of all the records identified by the search strategy, in accordance with the Cochrane recommendations.19 For this initial screening, all search results were imported into reference management software and duplicates were removed. The screening process assessed whether the citation: (1) reported data from an original research study using HCMs and (2) focused on cardiac arrest or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. If both criteria were met, the study was considered eligible. The two review authors rated each citation using a â€œrelevantâ€, â€œirrelevantâ€ or â€œunsureâ€ designation. Only full-text articles that received a â€œrelevantâ€ or â€œunsureâ€ classification from at least one of the two review authors were retrieved for citations. Out of 244 records identified, discrepancies of eligibility assessment between authors were encountered for 14 references. Full-text articles of records identified as being potentially relevant were independently assessed by the two authors for inclusion. Disagreements on eligibility were resolved in discussion between the reviewers. The reasons for excluding studies were recorded.A PRISMA-style flow diagram was drawn to illustrate the process of primary study selection from identification to inclusion in the systematic review (Fig. 1).The following data were collected for each study eligible when available: the type of cadaver and its characteristics and the intended purpose of the study. We also reported if chest compressions were applied and their modalities, if ventilation was performed, if declotting or perfusion techniques were used and if any other kind of equipment was used on the cadaver. Finally, we looked for any mention of the modelâ€™s quality assessment or limitations reported in those studies. Risk of bias (quality) assessment To provide an overview of the quality level of the studies included, we used the Cochrane RoB Tool developed by the Cochrane Collaboration20 to report the risk of bias (Appendix B). This tool evaluates seven different quality domains: (1) random sequence generation, (2) allocation concealment, (3) blinding of participants and personnel, (4) blinding of outcome assessment, (5) incomplete outcome data, (6) selective reporting and (7) other biases. The Cochrane RoB Tool was developed for randomised clinical trials and is not completely adequate for studies on cadaver models which include experimental studies. This means that some aspects of the quality assessment process needed to be adapted to the characteristics of the studies using HCMs. When the risk of bias for a specific domain was considered irrelevant in a given study by the authors, it was graded as â€œlowâ€. We graded as â€œunclear risk of other biasesâ€ studies lacking a description of the modelâ€™s characteristics, preparation or storage conditions in a way resulting in non-reproducible study conditions.

The different literature databases and original articles that were published in the time span of 2002-2012 in English language for determination of M. tuberculosis Haarlem family prevalence and occurrence rate of MDR in this family in worldwide population were obtained from valid and credible web sites: PubMed ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), Science Direct ( http://www.sciencedirect.com), Google Scholar ( http://www.scholar.google.co.uk), Biological Abstracts ( http://www.science.thomsonreuters.com) and ISI web of knowledge ( http://www.pcs.webofknowledge.com) in Thomsonreuters, the years of coverage of these web sites are 1955, 1977, 2006, 2009 and 1958, respectively. Also, some article was found in IranMedex ( http://www.iranmedex.com). We contacted several study authors in the cellular and molecular research center and microbiology department of Kurdistan University of medical sciences, located in Sanandaj, Iran to identify some additional studies. The last search was performed in the winter of 2012.For the means of searching in different websites, several key words were entered. For example TB Haarlem, molecular epidemiology, MDR and spoligotyping were entered in PubMed (Advanced search part). In some cases, search process got limited because in order to reach to some of the papersâ€™ full text, we should have had a specific username and password and hence we only used their abstracts which were available or free.Process for selecting the studiesAll the information in different articles and papers used in this study were surveyed by authors. Two reviewers did the searching independently. When there was any disagreement between them for selecting specific articles, they discoursed about selecting it. Also, eligibility for each paper was determined in Excel data sheets (CEB603, Chino-Excel Technology).The following data were extracted from original publications: Number of cases, websites, Author, Study place (country), Year of the research, Sample size, and prevalence of Haarlem and MDR association.Inclusion and exclusion criteriaInclusion criteriaResearch articles with full text,Articles with abstract in English.Excluded studiesReview articles,Congress abstracts,Studies that reported in languages other than English andStudies that were not available for us in abstract or full text,Studies that their sampling location was uncertain,Studies that locations of sampling was performed at the same time,Studies that their data were not clear.Data synthesis and meta-analysisVariables of our study were prevalence of TB infection and Haarlem family MDR in different countries (2002-2012). According to different studies performed in various countries, it was concluded that high levels of prevalence of TB infection and Haarlem family MDR can exist in different countries. Hence, the prevalence of Haarlem family of TB in 78 studies was the main outcome.The variance of the prevalence was computed using the binomial distribution (confidence interval [CI]: 95%). Meta-analysis with the random effect model was applied to combine the prevalence among studies. There was sensitivity (how the uncertainty in the output of a mathematical model or system can be apportioned to different sources of uncertainty in its inputs) and heterogeneity among studies.

Search Strategy
A series of systematic literature searches was conducted on May 25, 2016. Full terms used in all searches are listed in Supplementary Tables 1â€“5.
MEDLINE, Embase, and Embase Alert databases were searched using ProQuest Dialog (Ann Arbor, MI). The search strategy included multiple free-text terms covering the definition of innovation, combined with terms referring to health care, drugs, medicines, or pharmaceuticals. Additional searches combined healthcare terms with Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) and Emtree thesaurus index terms. Search results were limited to studies published from January 1, 2010, and filtered to exclude studies published only as conference abstracts. No language restriction was applied. The EconLit database was searched using the American Economics Association interface ( https://www.aeaweb.org/econlit/). EconLit search terms combined â€œinnovationâ€/â€innovativeâ€ with terms including definition, health, drug, and medicine. EconLit search results were restricted to journal articles published in English from January 1, 2010.
Study Selection
Search hits from the three databases were combined, and duplicates were removed using EndNote software (Thomson Reuters, New York, NY). Remaining duplicate articles and conference abstracts were manually removed and titles and abstracts screened for eligibility. Articles were included if they described a definition of innovation with respect to new medicines, or referred to a relevant definition published elsewhere. Articles presenting definitions of innovation in medical devices, surgical techniques, or service delivery were considered to be outside the scope of this review, and were excluded. Full-text versions of articles that passed title/abstract screening were retrieved for further review, and studies not meeting the inclusion criteria were excluded (Supplementary Table 6).
Where studies referred to a relevant definition of innovation published elsewhere, the cited references were screened for inclusion in the review; no date restriction was applied to references identified through citation searching.
Data Extraction and Analysis
Definitions of innovation were extracted from all included references. In addition, terms used to describe components of innovation in each of the included definitions were identified. Because a large number of terms were identified, many of which described similar concepts (for example, â€œtherapeutic benefitâ€ and â€œtherapeutic valueâ€), similar definition terms were clustered together into ten groups; therefore, the resultant â€œdimensions of innovationâ€ are derived from the identified terms, rather than being defined a priori. The mapping of definition terms onto the ten dimensions is shown in Supplementary Table 7. Definitions described in multiple publications were counted more than once in this analysis, but to avoid double-counting the same reference, the results of a previous systematic review of innovation (Reference Kesselheim, Wang and Avorn11) were excluded.
Supplementary Searches
Manual searches of relevant Web sites, including European HTA bodies, the European Medicines Agency, and key professional societies (for example, ASCO and ESMO), were conducted to identify stated policies or methods for assessing innovation. For HTA body Web sites, individual product assessments were not searched. Similarly, for professional societies, conference proceedings were excluded. A full list of Web sites searched and the search terms used is presented in the Supplementary Table 8. Because the Web site searches were not fully systematic, definitions identified from these sources were not included in the analysis of the dimensions of innovation.",False,1,1,True

Data sources and searches
An investigator (IYK) and an information
specialist from the University Health Network library services independently
performed the literature search. Studies were identified using Ovid MEDLINE
(1986â€“2012), EMBASE (inception to January 2012) Cochrane Central Registry of
Controlled Trials (inception to 2012) and CINAHL (inception to 2012). The
following keywords, alone or in combination, with mapping of term to subject
heading were used in the database search: â€œsclerodermaâ€, â€œsystemic sclerosisâ€,
â€œlung transplantationâ€, â€œpulmonary fibrosisâ€, and â€œpulmonary hypertensionâ€. No
language, publication date or publication status restrictions were imposed. The
results of the 2 independent searches were compared to ensure completeness.

Titles and abstracts were screened to identify
studies reporting survival post-lung transplantation in SSc patients. Studies

the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria [19], or
physician-based diagnosis), 2) lung transplantation (single lung, double lung

A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to evaluate the success of En-DCR or Ex-DCR with or without the use of MMC applied as an adjuvant treatment during the surgical procedure for the treatment of primary acquired NLDO. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors. The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee on Research in Human Beings of the Medical Schoolâ€”UNESP, Brazil, and recorded in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). Verification of the review items was performed according to the PRISMA 2009 checklist.A comprehensive literature search strategy was performed for the keywords: â€œdacryocystorhinostomyâ€ and â€œmitomycin-Câ€ and adapted for each database to achieve more sensitivity. Six databases were searched in this study including SCOPUS, Web of Science, PUBMED, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Libraryâ€”latest edition), EMBASE, and LILACS, from 1990 to the cutoff date of October 2019. There was no restriction on language. Additionally, the reference lists of the identified articles were also checked to ensure a thorough search of the literature.Inclusion criteria in this meta-analysis were randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving Ex-DCR or En-DCR comparing outcomes of surgeries with or without the use of MMC. Participants were adult patients with primary acquired NLDO. The intervention group was comprised of patients with primary acquired NLDO who underwent Ex-DCR or En-DCR with the use of mitomycin. The control group was comprised of patients with primary acquired NLDO who underwent Ex-DCR or En-DCR without the use of MMC. All studies included were required to provide the success rates of both the MMC and control groups, and the follow-up time was up to 3 months. Exclusion criteria were congenital or traumatic obstruction of the lacrimal system, canalicular obstruction, acute dacryocystitis, granulomatous systemic diseases affecting the lacrimal passages, previous lacrimal surgery, DCR using laser, and tumors of the lacrimal sac or paranasal sinuses with secondary obstruction of the lacrimal excretory system.The primary outcome was surgical success defined as subjective improvement in clinical symptoms, reported by patients, and/or in objective lacrimal system permeability tests, such as the fluorescein dye disappearance test, irrigation of the excretory lacrimal system, dacryocystography, computed tomography scan, and/or visualization of the endoscopic surgical ostium in the nasal cavity. The secondary outcome included adverse effects or complications from the procedure such as fibrosis, obstruction of the surgical ostium, hemorrhage, infection, and granulation or dehiscence observed in the intervention or control groups.Two reviewers performed the data collection and analysis and independently screened titles and abstracts for eligible studies. Unrelated studies of intraoperative use of MMC during Ex-DCR or En-DCR or duplicated studies were excluded. Then, a final decision was made on which studies would be included.Data were collected from eligible studies and summarized using a data extraction sheet especially for this review on the following categories of information: author, publication year, country of publication, number of patients, type of surgical intervention performed (Ex-DCR or En-DCR), intubation of the lacrimal drainage system with a stent, inclusion criteria, different concentrations, exposure time, mode of administering MMC, monitoring, follow-up, definition, criteria of success, and complications.The quality of the study was assessed using the â€œRisk of biasâ€ tool for Cochrane Reviews [17]. This tool uses six separate criteria, each classified according to the standards. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias in each study, and any disagreement was resolved by discussion or consensus involving all authors.The statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software, provided by the Cochrane Collaboration. The treatment effect and outcomes were measured as dichotomous variables and presented as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Clinical heterogeneity was verified by examining the details of the study (different concentrations of MMC and different exposure times for MMC applied), and then the statistical heterogeneity (I2) between the results was tested using the chi-square and I2 value [18]. A fixed-effect model was used for meta-analysis in the absence of heterogeneity (I2=0). If there was heterogeneity between studies and I2 was > 0, a random-effects model was applied [19].The results were summarized using a forest plot, in which each horizontal line represents an included study. The estimated effect was represented by a square, and the size of the square corresponds to the weight of the study in question. A diamond located at the bottom of the graph represented the combined effect estimate. The principles of GRADE (Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) were used to evaluate the strength of evidence of the primary outcome, and a summary table of findings was constructed using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) [20].",False,0,1,False

2.1 Search Strategy and  Study SelectionThe systematic review and meta-analysis on the role of miRNAs in melanoma were carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines [15]. The study search was carried out in bibliographic databases including EMBASE, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus and Web of science to identify relevant studies published between January 2011 and April 2018. A few studies were also obtained from the reference lists of these selected articles. Two authors (SS and MRM) performed the article search independently, and the corresponding author (RJ) performed a final review of the entire search and extracted articles.2.2  Selection CriteriaStudies included in our systematic review and meta-analysis were selected using the following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria: 1.        Studies that discussed the role of miRNAs and the survival outcome of melanoma patients. 2.        Studies that reported HR and 95% CI values. 3.        Articles published between 2012 and 2018. 4.        Studies that interpreted survival analysis (clinical end-point) with univariate or multivariate analysis. 5. Studies that were in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analysis. 6. Studies with Kaplanâ€“Meier (KM) curves were also selected if it was possible to retrieve HR and 95% CI values from the KM curves.Exclusion criteria:1.        Conference abstracts, reviews and letters to the editor were not within the scope of our analysis.2.        Studies reporting in vitro, in silico and other non-human (animal) miRNA expression.3.        Unpublished articles/theses and incomplete studies.4.        Studies that discussed tumour histology, tumour differentiation and other malignant potential specifically if they failed to discuss the survival outcomes of miRNA in melanoma.5.        Articles that reported prognosis results for a sample size less than ten.  2.3  Type of  ParticipantsThis current study involves clinical data from the patient cohorts in the included studies that were identified through the online search. There were no limitations of gender, age, tumour stage, lymph nodes or any treatment parameters. Similarly, data on tissue, serum, skin lesions and plasma samples from the included studies were included in this study to investigate the expression of miRNAs in melanoma patients. The follow-up period was extracted from the included studies.2.4  Data Extraction and  ManagementData were extracted from the included studies independently; any discrepancies were discussed amongst all authors, and the final decision was taken through a team decision. Using Microsoft ExcelÂ® (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA), data items were extracted after a manual check by the review team for evaluation of study quality and data synthesis. Data items such as author names, publication year, gender, study period, diagnostic methods, follow-up period, sunlight exposure, ulceration, TNM (tumour node metastasis) stages, endpoint determination, survival status and miRNA expressions were retrieved for further analysis. Endnote (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA) was used as a bibliographic reference manager to avoid duplication of the included studies.2.5  Quality Assessment and  Risk of  Bias of  Individual StudiesTwo reviewers performed quality assessment of the included studies independently using the quality assessment tool from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI): Quality Assessment of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Quality Assessment Tool for observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies [16]. Before attempting to extract the data items from the individual studies, a quality assessment was performed. This assessment tool was applied to all the selected full-text articles, and they were then categorised into good, fair or poor. Fourteen elements of quality assessment, including patient population and selection, study comparability, follow-up and outcome of interest, are addressed by this tool [16]. The risk of bias is inversely correlated with the quality of the study. While a high risk of bias translates to a rating of poor quality, a low risk of bias translates to a rating of good quality. The name and version of the assessment tool used, the risk of bias graph/summary, incomplete outcome data and other potential sources of bias were also assessed. Data were summarised using descriptive statistics (frequency, percentage).2.6  Assessment of  Heterogeneity and  StatisticsComprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software (version 3.3.070; Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA) was used to perform the meta-analysis to generate forest plots using HRs and associated 95% CIs of survival endpoints (overall survival [OS], disease-free survival [DFS], recurrence-free survival [RFS], metastasis-free survival [MFS], progression-free survival [PFS] and post-recurrence survival [PRS]) from the selected studies. The pooled effect size estimate of the HR was estimated using random-effects model meta-analysis. The effect size of the HR on melanoma patients indicates the important aspects of the prognostic impact of miRNAs. The mean effect size of the HR is a crucial tool in reporting and interpreting the effectiveness of miRNAs on melanoma patientsâ€™ prognosis, generally referring to the comparative and collective effect size estimates of the different studies. The mean effect estimate of the HR is more frequently used in meta-analysis than its statistical significance or the sample size of the individual studies [17, 18]. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Higgins I2 statistic and Cochranâ€™s Q-test [19]. Cochranâ€™s Q-test was used secondary to the I2 statistic given its low power of heterogeneity detection. In case of any discrepancy, the I2 statistic was given precedence [20]. The forest plots were analysed to elucidate the outcomes of patient survival in melanoma. Subgroup analysis was carried out for the repeated miRNAs with the same methods for cumulative meta-analysis.2.7 Publication BiasPublication bias was estimated to assess any bias in the included studies. Funnel plots, Orwin and classic fail-safe N tests [21], Begg and Mazumdar Rank correlation tests [22], the Harbord-Eggerâ€™s test of the intercept [23] and Duval and Tweedieâ€™s trim and fill method [24] calculations were used.2.7.1 Funnel PlotsFunnel plots for each, study effect size about their sample size were constructed with scattered plots, where a lack of skew or asymmetry indicated an absence of publication bias.2.7.2 Classic Failâ€‘Safe and Orwin Failâ€‘Safe N TestsBoth the Orwin fail-safe N test and classic fail-safe N test were applied to determine studies that are missing from the systematic review and meta-analysis, even with the advent of complete online bibliographic searching. These tests help to enumerate the studies in a meta-analysis which transfers the effect size towards null and also makes it possible to interpret whether it is true or false [21].2.7.3 Begg and Mazumdar Rank Correlation TestThe Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation test uses the correlation between the ranks of effect sizes and the ranks of their variances. Inverse correlation may occur between study size and effect size due to the sizeable prognostic effects in melanoma patients. Therefore, we estimated the rank order correlation (Kendallâ€™s tau-b) between the prognostic effect and the standard error (which is driven primarily by sample size). Positive values indicate a trend towards a higher level of test accuracy in studies with smaller sample sizes [22].2.7.4 Eggerâ€™s Test of the InterceptThe Egger regression gives the degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from a regression of standard normal which deviates against precision [23]. This test was performed to determine whether there is an association between test accuracy estimates (estimate divided by its standard error) and their precision (reciprocal of the standard error of the estimate).2.7.5 Duval and Tweedieâ€™s Trim and Fill MethodA rank-based method was used to estimate the number of missing studies from the meta-analysis due to suppression of the most extreme results on one side of the funnel plot and to produce an adjusted estimate of test accuracy by inputting suspected missing studies. It initially trims the asymmetric studies from the right-hand side to locate the unbiased effect (in an iterative procedure), and then fills the plot by re-inserting the trimmed studies on the right and their input-ted counterparts to the left of the mean effect [24].",False,0,0,True

Literature search
A systematic literature search was performed without language
restrictions in December 2012 in the following databases: PubMed, Transplant
Library, and Cochrane Library. The following search terms were used: â€œliver
transplantation,â€ â€œinterleukin 2 receptor inhibitor/antagonist,â€ â€œBas,â€ â€œDac,â€
â€œZenapax,â€ â€œSimulect,â€ â€œpediatric,â€ â€œchild,â€ â€œchildren,â€ and abbreviations
thereof. The keywords were combined with Boolean operators.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
All prospective, controlled pediatric studies and pediatric studies
with prospective Exp and historical Cont in which IL-2RA induction therapy in
liver transplant recipients was compared with placebo or no add-on were included.
A ï¬rst non-systematic review of the literature showed that in pediatric liver
transplantation, IL-2RA are used in addition to standard immunosuppression therapy
concepts to reduce other immunosuppressive drugs, such as CNI (3) and
corticosteroids (9, 10). We have therefore structured this meta-analysis into three
separate comparisons as follows:
In the ï¬rst group, IL-2RA are added to the Exp and are compared to
no add-on or placebo, while both study arms got equal concomitant
immunosuppressive medication. This group is referred to as the IL-2RA only
comparison in the following.
In the second group, IL-2RA are additionally combined with delayed
CNI in the experimental arm (delayed CNI comparison).
The third group compared IL-2RA with a standard immunosuppressive
protocol with reduced or even dropped steroids in the experimental arm (the
no/low steroids comparison). Other immunosuppressive medication had to be the
same in both treatment arms, for example, MMF.
All retrospective, non-controlled pediatric studies and pediatric
studies with multi-organ transplantation or re-transplantation were excluded.
Pharmacological studies that did not provide data on clinical outcome measures
were excluded as well because of their very short follow-up time.
The literature search strategy was designed and performed by two
reviewers (N.D.C., A.D.G.). Publications were screened independently by two
reviewers (N.D.C., A.D.G.). Disagreement and any discrepancies were resolved by
discussion of all four reviewers.
Outcome measures
The primary outcomes analyzed were AR, steroid-resistant rejection,
graft loss, and patient death. Secondary outcomes were ADR namely renal
dysfunction by need of dialysis or oliguria, de novo malignancy (excluding
recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma), PTLD, infection complications,
including fungal, viral, and bacterial infections, new onset of metabolic and
cardiovascular disorders such as HTN, HLP, and PTDM.
Study quality
The quality items assessed were blinding, randomization, allocation
concealment, ITT analysis, completeness of follow-up, and the method of handling
missing values. Assessment was performed according to deï¬nitions stated in
the Cochrane Handbook (15, Ch. 8). Quality of studies was assessed
independently by two reviewers (N.D.C., A.D.G.) without blinding to journal and
authorship. Furthermore, completeness of follow-up was deï¬ned as the number
of patients that were not lost to follow-up. We reported completeness of
follow-up as stated by the authors. Methods of handling missing values are
stated as reported by the authors of the respective study.
Data extraction
All available data for the described outcome measures were extracted
at all available timepoints from individual trials. In contrast to kidney
transplants, it has been shown that morphological signs of rejection in protocol
biopsies of transplanted livers without clinical correlates require no treatment
and have no long-term ADR (18). Therefore, we only included treated ARs in the
primary analysis, when the reported AR was stratiï¬ed into â€œtreatedâ€ and
â€œnon-treated.â€ When data on outcome measures were not provided or studies seemed
to be duplicates, the authors were contacted to provide more data. Data
extraction was performed by one reviewer (N.D.C.) using a standardized form and
checked by two reviewers (A.D.G, C.R.).
Data analysis
We expressed the results of dichotomous outcomes as RR with values
smaller than one favoring IL-2RA. When no event was observed in both arms, we
excluded it from corresponding comparison (15, Ch.16.9.3). We performed the
analysis using a random eï¬€ects model, as in case of doubt, it makes more sense
to use the more general approach (including the ï¬xed-eï¬€ects model as a
special case), which will usually lead to more conservative results (19). For
the random eï¬€ects models, the amount of residual heterogeneity (i.e., sÂ²) was
estimated by the REML method (20). CIs for sÂ² were obtained by the Q-proï¬le
method (21). The model parameters were estimated by way of weighted least
squares, with weights equal to the inverse sum of the variance of the
estimate and the estimate of the residual heterogeneity. Then, Wald-type tests
and CIs were obtained for the parameter estimates (20). We analyzed
heterogeneity among studies using Cochraneâ€™s Q test and calculating IÂ² to
measure the proportion of total variation due to heterogeneity beyond chance
(22).
We performed subgroup analyses for primary outcomes which had
signiï¬cant results. Subgroups and factors deï¬ned a priori were methodological
quality of trial (i.e., randomized vs. non-randomized), comparison group, type
of IL-2RA, type of CNI, and use of MMF. For the primary analysis, we pooled
eï¬€ect measurements from trials with diï¬€erent follow-up time; but timepoint of
measurement (grouped by six months vs. 12 months and later) was evaluated in a
subgroup analysis. In some of the subgroups, a valid analysis was not possible.
To examine the inï¬‚uence of covariates aï¬€ecting the direction and/or strength
of the relation between dependent and independent variables, we used the
moderator test. For statistically signiï¬cant results, we calculated the NNT
describing how many patients are needed to be treated with an intervention, here
IL-2RA, to prevent one patient from having one additional bad outcome, here for
example AR.
Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots (23) and tests for
funnel plot asymmetry (20).

 paper was independently judged by two of the authors (D.G. and S.B.),

Search strategy
The different literature databases and original articles that were published in the time span of 2002-2012 in English language for determination of M. tuberculosis Haarlem family prevalence and occurrence rate of MDR in this family in worldwide population were obtained from valid and credible web sites: PubMed ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), Science Direct ( http://www.sciencedirect.com), Google Scholar ( http://www.scholar.google.co.uk), Biological Abstracts ( http://www.science.thomsonreuters.com) and ISI web of knowledge ( http://www.pcs.webofknowledge.com) in Thomsonreuters, the years of coverage of these web sites are 1955, 1977, 2006, 2009 and 1958, respectively. Also, some article was found in IranMedex ( http://www.iranmedex.com). We contacted several study authors in the cellular and molecular research center and microbiology department of Kurdistan University of medical sciences, located in Sanandaj, Iran to identify some additional studies. The last search was performed in the winter of 2012. For the means of searching in different websites, several key words were entered. For example TB Haarlem, molecular epidemiology, MDR and spoligotyping were entered in PubMed (Advanced search part). In some cases, search process got limited because in order to reach to some of the papersâ€™ full text, we should have had a specific username and password and hence we only used their abstracts which were available or free.
Data extraction and assessment of studies quality
Process for selecting the studies
All the information in different articles and papers used in this study were surveyed by authors. Two reviewers did the searching independently. When there was any disagreement between them for selecting specific articles, they discoursed about selecting it. Also, eligibility for each paper was determined in Excel data sheets (CEB603, Chino-Excel Technology). The following data were extracted from original publications: Number of cases, websites, Author, Study place (country), Year of the research, Sample size, and prevalence of Haarlem and MDR association.

Data synthesis and meta-analysis
Variables of our study were prevalence of TB infection and Haarlem family MDR in different countries (2002-2012). According to different studies performed in various countries, it was concluded that high levels of prevalence of TB infection and Haarlem family MDR can exist in different countries. Hence, the prevalence of Haarlem family of TB in 78 studies was the main outcome. The variance of the prevalence was computed using the binomial distribution (confidence interval [CI]: 95%). Meta-analysis with the random effect model was applied to combine the prevalence among studies. There was sensitivity (how the uncertainty in the output of a mathematical model or system can be apportioned to different sources of uncertainty in its inputs) and heterogeneity among studies.

We aimed to identify and appraise the up-to date scientific literature 
about the effect of non-pharmacological interventions delivered by 
non-physician HPs to prevent and manage osteoporotic fracture in 
high-risk adults, age 50 years or more. High risk of osteoporotic 
fracture was categorised using BMD values for low bone mass (osteopenia)
 and osteoporosis specified by WHO,15 and/or short-term probability of 
fracture. The definition we used for high-risk adults is detailed in 
table 1.The aim of this SLR was to inform an international EULAR 
taskforce on a broad range of issues related to non-physician HPsâ€™ 
interventions. Non-physician HPs deliver different interventions in 
different countries. Therefore, we focused our review on interventions 
that could potentially be delivered by non-physician HPs, independent of
 whether a study was led by a non-physician HP or not.A SLR for each
 of eight clinical questions (table 2), formulated and consensually 
agreed by the taskforce, was undertaken by a research fellow (NW) with 
guidance from the taskforce convenors (EH, JA) and a methodologist 
(TAS). The methods for each SLR, including the research question and 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, were agreed on and documented within a 
joint taskforce meeting. The taskforce comprised 2 patient research 
partners, 1 dietitian, 1 geriatrician and 1 nurse, 3  occupational 
therapists, 2 orthopaedic surgeons, 4 physiotherapists, 1 specialist in 
physical medicine and rehabilitation and 5 rheumatologists, drawn from 
10 European countries.The conduct of the review was informed by
 Cochrane principles.16 A Participants, Interventions, Comparisons, 
Outcomes and Study design approach17 was adopted for each question 
followed by a systematic search across international electronic 
databases  (Medline/PubMed, Embase and Cumulative Index to Nursing and 
Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) for relevant literature published 
between January 2007 and October 2017 (online supplementary file 1). 
Searches were based on two critieria: (1) adultsâ‰¥50 years of age at high
 risk of primary or secondary osteoporotic fracture and (2) 
interventions delivered by non-physician HPs to prevent and manage 
osteoporotic fractures. Interventions included diagnostic procedures to 
identify risk of falling, therapeutic approaches (eg, structured 
exercise, education, falls prevention programmes) and implementation 
strategies. Key outcomes were fractures and falls (where the accepted 
definition of a fall was an unexpected event in which the participants 
come to rest on the ground, floor or lower level18). High risk of 
falling and change in BMD were included as surrogate end points. 
Fractures in adults age â‰¥50 years were assumed to be fragility fractures
 unless at the ankle, hands and feet, skull and face,19 or as a result 
of high-intensity trauma.Study selectionFollowing
 removal of duplicates, two review authors (NW and EH) independently 
selected eligible studies and achieved consensus on which articles to 
include. Publications investigating interventions commonly undertaken by
 non-physician HPs were included even if the professional group 
delivering the intervention was not specifically stated or non-physician
 HPs were not sole providers. Articles were excluded if published in 
languages other than English.  Systematic reviews and randomised 
controlled trials (RCTs) were preferentially selected, although (quasi) 
randomised and non-randomised studies were included. Systematic reviews 
with sufficient quality were considered to cover the time until their 
search ended. Studies with small sample sizes (50% of the population had at least one fragility fracture, 
the study was allocated to question 2; if â‰¤50%, the study was allocated 
to question 3. If more than one published article reported data from a 
single cohort, the most up-to-date publication was included in the 
analysis.","### Q12:

Search strategyThe review was published in PROSPERO (International Prospective register of systematic reviews) with the registration number CRD42016051662. We used the PRISMA 2009 checklist15 (Fig. 1) to establish the protocol. We searched MEDLINE, Embase and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception until December 2016 for publications written in English, using the key words: telemedicine, telerehabilitation, telemonitoring, telehealth, deglutition disorders, eating disorders, swallowing, swallowing disorders, dysphagia. Details of search terms and strategies specific for each database are available in Appendix 1. We also searched grey literature such as Google Scholar, reference lists of articles, from inception until December 2016. We identified published and unpublished trials, by hand searching the reference lists from relevant articles.Selection criteriaStudies were eligible for inclusion if they tested telerehabilitation for the recovery of swallowing functions in patients affected by dysphagia due to any type of impairment or disease, including randomised controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-randomised controlled trials with or without blinding of examiner(s). We excluded studies on patients with swallowing disorders due to malocclusion and atypical deglutition. We considered studies focusing on swallowing interventions using telerehabilitation, which includes therapeutic exercises, compensative manoeuvre, monitoring and counselling. In the context of this systematic review, telerehabilitation was considered as:â€¢ provided by means of any kind of technological device;â€¢ allowing healthcare professional/patient interaction both on-line (via a videoconferencing system, the therapist connects to the patientâ€™s device, taking control and interacting directly, giving rehabilitation session exactly as it is in the presence of the patient) or off-line (the patient performs the rehabilitation activities prescribed independently using the device);â€¢ provided by healthcare professionals or caregivers through remote supervision.Data collection and analysisTwo authors (SN and IB) independently screened the titles and abstracts of the 330 records retrieved from the search strategy, applying the selection criteria previously described. The full text of the possible eligible records were retrieved and analysed for final inclusion in this systematic review. Any disagreement was resolved through discussion and contacting a third author (TI), if needed.Two authors (SN and IB) independently extracted the data from the included study, using a standard form, in which the items extracted were: details of the participants (i.e. age, gender, type of disease); inclusion/exclusion criteria for patientsâ€™ eligibility; duration, intensity and frequency of interventions and controls; description of telerehabilitation programme; outcomes assessed.Quality assessmentTwo authors (SN and IB) independently evaluated the methodological quality of the included studies, using the Cochrane Collaborationâ€™s tool for assessing risk of bias16.

Literature searchWe performed a systematic literature search in the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Ovid Medline, Wanfang database (www.wanfangdata.com.cn), and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI, www.cnki.net) to identify studies involving the role of YKL-40 in patients with COPD, with the most recent search having been conducted on April 21, 2017. The key search terms were as follows: (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease OR COPD OR chronic airway inflammatory disease) AND (YKL-40 OR CHI3L1 OR HCgp-39 OR chitinase-3-like-1 protein OR human cartilage glycoprotein-39). The language was restricted to English or Chinese. Moreover, we conducted a web-based search in several commercial Internet search engines (such as Baidu Scholar and Google Scholar) using the same keywords. All analyses in the current meta-analysis were based on previously published studies; thus, no ethical approval and patient consent are required.Study selectionThe inclusion criteria were defined as follows: 1) a study involving the role of YKL-40 in COPD designed as a cohort study or caseâ€“control study; 2) if there was duplication of data, only the most complete and recent study was included; and 3) a primary study provided available data for counting standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) the study was not designed as a cohort study or caseâ€“control study; 2) a study did not provide available data for counting effect size or was missing other essential information; and 3) review, abstract, or overlapping study.Study quality score evaluationThe qualities of identified studies involving the role of YKL-40 in COPD were evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), and the scale to investigate quality was based on three aspects: selection, comparability, and exposure in the primary study. The total score ranged from 0 to 9 (0â€“3, 4â€“6, and 7â€“9 was considered low-, moderate-, and high-quality, respectively). The quality of the studies was assessed in a consensus meeting with all authors.Data extractionTwo independent authors (Xiang Tong and Dongguang Wang) extracted the detailed information and data from each primary study using a predesigned data extraction Excel form. If there was any disagreement or doubt, the third author (Sitong Liu) further reviewed these articles. The information and data extraction included the following: first author, year of publication, ethnicity, age of participant, serum, and sputum YKL-40 levels, correlation coefficient (r), sample size of patients and controls, and Fisherâ€™s Z-value, and method of YKL-40 measurement. If a study only provided medians and ranges (or interquartile ranges [IQR]), we transformed the data to approximate means and standard deviations following the validated methods proposed by Wan et al.16 Additionally, if the Fisherâ€™s Z-value could not be directly obtained from the publication, Fisherâ€™s r-to-Z transformation was used to convert each correlation coefficient into their approximately associated Z statistics, which is considered the normal distribution.17Statistical methodsIn the present study, all data analyses were performed using STATA 12.0 and SPSS 21.0 software. After appropriate conversion, we chose the random-effect model to synthesize data from the various studies because it is thought to be more conservative, incorporates better between-study variance terms, and produces a lower type I error rate as well as a wider CI for the pooled effects estimate when compared with the fixed-effect model.18 The SMD with 95% CI was used to compare the levels of serum or sputum YKL-40 in the COPD patients with the levels in healthy population. Regarding the pooled correlation coefficient, we used Fisherâ€™s Z-value to calculate the related statistic (summary Z-value) and 95% CI by the methods described in the previous study, and then transferred them back to summary effect size (summary r-value) using Fisherâ€™s Z-to-r transformation procedure.17 The between-study heterogeneity was investigated by the chi-squared-based Q-test and I-squared (I2) statistics test. A P-value of ,0.10 or an I2-value of .50% suggested a statistically significant heterogeneity. If a notable heterogeneity was found, we used a Kruskalâ€“Wallis test to directly compare the levels of serum YKL-40 in the COPD patients with the levels in controls and reported the results of this analysis as the median and IQR. Additionally, meta-regression analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to investigate the sources of heterogeneity. We further carried out subgroup analysis to determine the effect of status of disease (exacerbation vs stable). Moreover, the visual inspection of asymmetry in funnel plots was used to assess publication bias, and the Beggâ€™s and Eggerâ€™s tests were used to further detect publication bias.",False,1,1,True

Search strategyThe authors searched MEDLINE (1946 to present),
Embase (1974 to 3 June 2016), Web of Science (1945 to present), CENTRAL (issue
5 of 12, May 2016), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (issue 2 of
4, April 2015), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (issue 6 of
12, June 2016) for relevant articles, using a maximally sensitive strategy
(Appendix 1). The authors excluded animal studies, case reports, comments,
letters, and editorials. All other study types were included in the search
strategy. The authors searched for studies in both children and adults. There
were no limits on language or date of publication. The authors performed
citation searches of all full-text papers retrieved, to identify other relevant
studies.Data extractionFollowing exclusion of duplicate
studies, all titles and abstracts were screened independently by two authors,
using the following inclusion criteria:â€¢  Population â€” patients presenting to
first-assessment settings, including community-based health care and
emergency departments (EDs), with symptoms suggestive of serious bacterial
infection;â€¢  Intervention â€” point-of-care lactate testing;â€¢  Comparator â€” usual care; andâ€¢  Outcomes â€” at least one patient outcome
(for example, mortality, time to treatment, length of stay). Purely diagnostic
accuracy studies were excluded, given this reviewâ€™s focus on clinical
outcomes (and the potential circularity of lactate measurement being required
for diagnosis of sepsis according to some existing definitions of sepsis).The
full texts of remaining articles were independently screened by pairings of two
authors, and reviewed for inclusion according to the specified criteria. Disagreements
were resolved by discussion with a third reviewer.Two authors independently
extracted data using a proforma. The full papers were used where possible
(four studies), with abstracts used if no full paper was available (four
studies). The primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included time
to lactate result, time to antibiotic and intravenous (IV) fluid treatment, and
length of stay. Authors were contacted for further clarification or missing
data where necessary.Quality assessmentQuality assessment was undertaken
independently by two authors using the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomised studies
of interventions.9 Quality was determined on a scale from low risk of bias
(comparable with a well-performed randomised controlled trial [RCT]), to
critical risk of bias (too problematic to provide any useful evidence on the
effects of the intervention).Data synthesisThere were insufficient data with
acceptable risk of bias to perform meta-analysis.",False,1,1,True

Literature searchThis study was exempt from institutional review board approval at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine as data were gathered from published literature. The following databases were searched for articles before May 01, 2018: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Global Resource of EczemA Trials, and Web of Science. The search strategy was modiï¬ed from previous reviews of AD21 and extracutaneous infection (Table I).22,23 Inclusion criteria were any retrospective or prospective studies that evaluated the relationship between AD and bacterial infections with a control group and included at least 20 AD patients (children or adults of male or female sex) published online, in print, or in press in any language before May 01, 2018. Title and abstract review were performed by 1 reviewer (Dr Serrano). Studies were excluded on the basis of the title or abstract if there was no clear indication they evaluated the relationship between AD and bacterial infections. The remaining articles progressed to fulltext review and were completely reviewed for inclusion. If data were duplicated in>1 study, the most recent and complete study was included.Data extractionThe following data items, if available, were collected: ï¬rst author; year of publication; study design; geographical region; number of persons with AD, bacterial infections, or both enrolled in the study; AD severity; age range; sex proportion; and AD and infection diagnostic criteria.Study quality assessmentA modiï¬ed version of the NewcastleOttawa Scale was used to assess study quality of crosssectional studies in metaanalysis.24 The scoring system summarized 7 aspects of each study: research design, recruitment strategy, response rate, representativeness of sample, objectivity/reliability of outcome determination, power calculation provided, and appropriate statistical analyses. The full score was 10 stars, and the high quality study was defined as a study with >6 stars.Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed using MedCalc for Windows version 18.5 (Ostend, Belgium). Pooled meta-analyses were performed on all outcomes assessed in >3 studies. Prevalences, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% conï¬dence intervals (CIs) were estimated. Random effects estimates were generated owing to signiï¬cant heterogeneity (I2 >43% for all analyses). Forest plots were generated.

performed the literature search. Studies were identified using Ovid MEDLINE
(1986â€“2012), EMBASE (inception to January 2012) Cochrane Central Registry of
Controlled Trials (inception to 2012) and CINAHL (inception to 2012). The
following keywords, alone or in combination, with mapping of term to subject
heading were used in the database search: â€œsclerodermaâ€, â€œsystemic sclerosisâ€,
â€œlung transplantationâ€, â€œpulmonary fibrosisâ€, and â€œpulmonary hypertensionâ€. No
language, publication date or publication status restrictions were imposed. The
results of the 2 independent searches were compared to ensure completeness.

studies reporting survival post-lung transplantation in SSc patients. Studies
were included if they reported 1) human SSc patients (classified as SSc using
the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria [19], or
physician-based diagnosis), 2) lung transplantation (single lung, double lung

We designed a standard data collection form but did not register the protocol or form.Eligibility CriteriaClear inclusion and exclusion criteria were produced to obtain articles relevant to the study objectives. The patient population was defined as pediatric, age under 18 years, and those patients undergoing surgical correction for TCF.The inclusion criteria included age 11 was considered to have low level of bias, whereas a value of","### Q12:

Search strategyThe search strategy was developed using the predefined terms â€˜thrombocytosisâ€™ or â€˜plateletâ€™ or â€˜thrombocyteâ€™ or â€˜thrombocyte countâ€™; and â€˜cancerâ€™ or â€˜malignan*â€™; and â€˜primary careâ€™ or â€˜primary medical careâ€™ or â€˜family practiceâ€™ or â€˜family medicineâ€™. The search was limited to English language articles published in the last 30 years, was first carried out in June 2015, and updated in February 2016. The following databases were searched: EMBASE (OvidSP), Medline (Ovid), Web of Science and The Cochrane Library. Forwards and backwards citation searching was carried out on included articles. Relevant experts in the field were asked if they had authored any relevant studies that had collected platelet count data. All results were exported to Endnote X5 and deduplicated. The study protocol can be accessed at  http://hdl.handle.net/10871/20964.Study selectionThe search aimed to identify any study that had investigated the association between thrombocytosis and new diagnosis of cancer of any type in primary care. Inclusion criteria were as follows: adults aged â‰¥40, primary care setting and observational, caseâ€“control or cohort study or any literature review. Those under 40 years of age were excluded as cancers in this age group tend to be familial or atypical (indeed, no studies of lower age groups were identified in the searches). Studies that had investigated platelet count as a prognostic tool or guide for cancer therapy were excluded. Titles and abstracts were screened by two authors (SB and ES). Full text articles were retrieved and assessed for inclusion.Data analysisStudy quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool (27). Studies were assessed for bias in four areas: patient selection, index test, reference standard and flow and timing.Raw data were extracted into custom-made data extraction forms; this was duplicated by SB and WH. Data were bought together in a narrative synthesis following the general framework set out in the Centre for Reviews and Disseminationâ€™s Guidance for Undertaking Reviews in Health Care (28). Raw data from each study concerning the number of cases and healthy controls with thrombocytosis were used to calculate the likelihood ratio (LR: the probability of raised platelets in patients with cancer divided by the probability of raised platelets in healthy patients) and the positive predictive value (PPV) using Bayesâ€™ Theorem. This approach to calculate PPVs is used with caseâ€“control study data as it accommodates prevalence in the general population, a necessary adjustment as prevalence is artificially high in caseâ€“control studies. Thus, PPVs were calculated as the LR multiplied by the prior odds of the disease (29); in this case, primary care incidence data were used to calculate prior odds.Subgroups were defined based on whether the cancer affects both sexes or one (males and females or females only), the data sources used by the studies and the source of the studies themselves (identified through literature search or contact with experts).",False,0,1,False

Literature search
This meta-analysis is being reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement [7]. A search strategy using a combination of free-text words, relevant MeSH headings (Supplementary Material, File S1) and appropriate restrictions (time limit: from January 2004 to March 2020, language: English) was designed. A systematic literature search was performed in EMBASE (via Ovid), MEDLINE (via PubMed) and Cochrane CENTRAL.
Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials or observational studies comparing NITLs to thoracoscopic lobectomies under GA. Letters, editorials, case reports, propensity score matching analyses, expert opinions, meta-analyses and reviews were excluded. Records identified through our search strategy were imported into reference management software. In case of duplication, the most recent paper was selected. Two authors worked independently to assess each identified study based on the eligibility criteria. When multiple studies contained overlapping data, the most informative study was included. Disagreements were discussed and resolved by consensus with a third investigator. After preliminary title/abstract screening, potentially eligible papers underwent an in-depth full-text review to select studies to be included in the meta-analysis. Data extracted included study characteristics, baseline patient characteristics and primary and secondary outcomes. The Cochrane Collaborationâ€™s tool was used to determine the risk of bias for the primary outcome for included studies [8]. The risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data was evaluated at an outcome level. In contrast, the risk of bias due to sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, selective reporting or funding was evaluated at the study level. The risk of bias was determined by 2 independent reviewers, and disagreements were settled by discussion and consensus. Details of the protocol for this systematic review were registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO): CRD42017072141 ( https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/).
Statistical analyses
To calculate dichotomous variables, the Mantelâ€“Haenszel formula was used to generate a pooled effect estimate in the form of risk ratios along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, the mean differences (MDs) were pooled and weighted by generic inverse variance and computed by random effects modelling. When the continuous outcome was reported in some studies as median, range and interquartile range, means and standard deviations were estimated using the methods reported in the literature [9]. A statistically significant overall effect was defined as P-value",False,0,1,False

Data sources and searches
An investigator (IYK) and an information
specialist from the University Health Network library services independently
performed the literature search. Studies were identified using Ovid MEDLINE
(1986â€“2012), EMBASE (inception to January 2012) Cochrane Central Registry of
Controlled Trials (inception to 2012) and CINAHL (inception to 2012). The
following keywords, alone or in combination, with mapping of term to subject
heading were used in the database search: â€œsclerodermaâ€, â€œsystemic sclerosisâ€,
â€œlung transplantationâ€, â€œpulmonary fibrosisâ€, and â€œpulmonary hypertensionâ€. No
language, publication date or publication status restrictions were imposed. The
results of the 2 independent searches were compared to ensure completeness.
Study selection

studies reporting survival post-lung transplantation in SSc patients. Studies
were included if they reported 1) human SSc patients (classified as SSc using
the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria [19], or
physician-based diagnosis), 2) lung transplantation (single lung, double lung
or heart lung transplantation), and 3) reported survival as an outcome. The

In a second step, the analysis was restricted to those studies fulfilling defined criteria concerning their composition of age (time of exposure), residence (intensity of exposure) and sex (Age: Matching on age with a maximum interval of 5 years, or Standardization on age with a maximum interval of 5 years; Residence: Matching by village, or Stratification by endemicity level; Sex: Matching on sex, or Results reported separately for males and females). These criteria were based on the known relationship between the respective parameters and infection status with O. volvulus and were also guided by the suggestions made for epidemiological studies on the association between cysticercosis and epilepsy [22]. Pooled ORs and 95% CI were calculated for studies presenting qualitative indicators of onchocerciasis infection whereas pooled standardized mean differences (SMD) and Cohenâ€™s d statistics were computed for studies presenting quantitative assessment of onchocerciasis infection [23]. All pooled calculations included a test of homogeneity of means. Pooled ORs were estimated using random-effects models (DerSimonian-Laird method) and heterogeneity of studies was assessed using Cochraneâ€™s Q chi-squared tests and the I2 statistics [24,25]. The latter describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance.

All prospective, controlled pediatric studies and pediatric studies with prospective Exp and historical Cont in which IL-2RA induction therapy in liver transplant recipients was compared with placebo or no add-on were included. A ï¬rst non-systematic review of the literature showed that in pediatric liver transplantation, IL-2RA are used in addition to standard immunosuppression therapy concepts to reduce other immunosuppressive drugs, such as CNI (3) and corticosteroids (9, 10). We have therefore structured this meta-analysis into three separate comparisons as follows:In the ï¬rst group, IL-2RA are added to the Exp and are compared to no add-on or placebo, while both study arms got equal concomitant immunosuppressive medication. This group is referred to as the IL-2RA only comparison in the following. In the second group, IL-2RA are additionally combined with delayed CNI in the experimental arm (delayed CNI comparison). The third group compared IL-2RA with a standard immunosuppressive protocol with reduced or even dropped steroids in the experimental arm (the no/low steroids comparison). Other immunosuppressive medication had to be the same in both treatment arms, for example, MMF.All retrospective, non-controlled pediatric studies and pediatric studies with multi-organ transplantation or re-transplantation were excluded. Pharmacological studies that did not provide data on clinical outcome measures were excluded as well because of their very short follow-up time.",False,0,1,False

warfarin reversal for surgery or an invasive procedure. We selected only
studies comparing PCC (either 3F- or 4F-PCC) to FFP. Studies that evaluated a
com-bination of PCCs and FFP or factor VIIa as a co-intervention were excluded.

Search strategy
A literature search was performed following PRISMA guidelines
[28] using the PubMed, Web of Science, PsychINFO and Scopus databases. Original
papers published in scientific journals and written in English, French, Spanish,
Italian and Portuguese were searched, with no country restriction. Timeframe
was limited to January 2000 December 2016. The search terms and selection
strategy are listed in Table 1 and were used in all possible combinations. MeSH
terms were used whenever possible. Additional studies were identified through
the reference lists of included studies and from previous reviews.
Study selection
The papers retrieved following the first general search were
evaluated based on title and abstract in order to exclude duplicates and those
not focused on ARFD knowledge (by instance papers about sexuality, contraception,
pregnancy and abortion). Because we aimed to evaluate ARFD knowledge in people
not concerned by a medical condition or treatment threatening fertility (e.g.
VIH, cancer), papers on gametes cryopreservation for medical reasons were also
excluded. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are summarized in Table 1.
Study screening
Selected articles were full-text reviewed to determine if they
evaluated ARFD qualitatively or quantitatively. Only papers evaluating the
following questions quantitatively were retained: What is the most fertile age
for a woman? (Q1). When there is a slight decrease in female fertility? (Q2)
and, When there is a marked decrease in female fertility? (Q3). Each paper was
independently judged by two of the authors (D.G. and S.B.), who finally agreed
on the inclusion of 41 publications. The main reasons for the exclusion of
published articles about ARFD were: not asking for the specific ages at which
female fertility decrease occurs; reporting overall score of questionnaire, but
not of individual items; evaluating a set of data collected in previous
publications already included in this review.
Data collection
The design of the study, response rate, year, country, size,
population characteristics (age, gender, country area and education level), instrument
used to measure ARFD knowledge performed intervention (if any), and results as
percentage of answers to each questionâ€™s options were recorded. The instruments
employed to measure ARFD knowledge are specified in Table 2. Twenty-two studies
(53.7%) used either the Swedish Awareness Questionnaire [29â€“31] or a
questionnaire based in it. The questions were worded as: Q1) At what age are
women the most fertile? Q2) At what age is there a slight decrease in womenâ€™s
ability to become pregnant?, and Q3) At what age is there a marked decrease in
womenâ€™s ability to become pregnant? The Fertility Awareness Survey (FAS) and the
Cardiff Fertility Knowledge Scale (CFKS) were used in 3 studies each. The FAS
only assess one of the three questions evaluated in this review (Q3) but,
instead of directly asking the question â€œAt what age is there a marked decrease
in womenâ€™s ability to become pregnant?â€, participants are asked to rate the
sentence â€œThere is a progressive decrease in a womanâ€™s ability to become
pregnant after the age of 35â€ as â€œdefinitely notâ€, â€œprobably notâ€, â€œuncertainâ€,
â€œprobablyâ€ or â€œdefinitelyâ€ [32,33] or as â€œtrueâ€, â€œfalseâ€ or â€œuncertainâ€ [34].
Regarding the CFKS, its individual questions were not available. The remaining
12 studies used questionnaires specifically designed for the studies and most
of them asked for the age when female fertility decreases, without
differentiating between a slight and a marked decrease. Answers considered as
â€œcorrectâ€ in each individual paper are indicated. When available, the results
before and after an educational intervention are also reported.",False,0,1,False

Search StrategiesAll relevant studies published before 
December 30, 2016 were identified through an extended computed-based 
search of PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE) and the Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). The search terms were 
as follows: â€œRomiplostimâ€, â€œEltrombopagâ€, â€œITPâ€, â€œchildâ€ 
â€œThrombopoietinâ€. Filters were applied in Pubmed to restrict our search 
to studies done on human subjects only.Two of the authors (JTM, ZKe)
 screened the title and abstract of retrieved records to assess the 
eligibility and full text selection of eligible studies to conduct 
meta-analysis. Disagreements weresolved by fully discussing 
with the third senior investigator to reach a consensus. The following 
data were extracted from each study: first authorâ€™s name, study design, 
duration of illness, initial platelet counts, participantâ€™s particulars,
 outcome of interest, and type of regimen used.Inclusion and Exclusion CriteriaRCTs were included based on the following criteria:(I) Studies which examined the efficacy and safety of TPORAs use in children with chronic ITP.(II) Studies in which population were children with a clinical diagnosis of chronic ITP and a platelet count","### Q15:

We aimed to identify and appraise the up-to date scientific literature 
about the effect of non-pharmacological interventions delivered by 
non-physician HPs to prevent and manage osteoporotic fracture in 
high-risk adults, age 50 years or more. High risk of osteoporotic 
fracture was categorised using BMD values for low bone mass (osteopenia)
 and osteoporosis specified by WHO,15 and/or short-term probability of 
fracture. The definition we used for high-risk adults is detailed in 
table 1.The aim of this SLR was to inform an international EULAR 
taskforce on a broad range of issues related to non-physician HPsâ€™ 
interventions. Non-physician HPs deliver different interventions in 
different countries. Therefore, we focused our review on interventions 
that could potentially be delivered by non-physician HPs, independent of
 whether a study was led by a non-physician HP or not.A SLR for each
 of eight clinical questions (table 2), formulated and consensually 
agreed by the taskforce, was undertaken by a research fellow (NW) with 
guidance from the taskforce convenors (EH, JA) and a methodologist 
(TAS). The methods for each SLR, including the research question and 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, were agreed on and documented within a 
joint taskforce meeting. The taskforce comprised 2 patient research 
partners, 1 dietitian, 1 geriatrician and 1 nurse, 3  occupational 
therapists, 2 orthopaedic surgeons, 4 physiotherapists, 1 specialist in 
physical medicine and rehabilitation and 5 rheumatologists, drawn from 
10 European countries.The conduct of the review was informed by
 Cochrane principles.16 A Participants, Interventions, Comparisons, 
Outcomes and Study design approach17 was adopted for each question 
followed by a systematic search across international electronic 
databases  (Medline/PubMed, Embase and Cumulative Index to Nursing and 
Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) for relevant literature published 
between January 2007 and October 2017 (online supplementary file 1). 
Searches were based on two critieria: (1) adultsâ‰¥50 years of age at high
 risk of primary or secondary osteoporotic fracture and (2) 
interventions delivered by non-physician HPs to prevent and manage 
osteoporotic fractures. Interventions included diagnostic procedures to 
identify risk of falling, therapeutic approaches (eg, structured 
exercise, education, falls prevention programmes) and implementation 
strategies. Key outcomes were fractures and falls (where the accepted 
definition of a fall was an unexpected event in which the participants 
come to rest on the ground, floor or lower level18). High risk of 
falling and change in BMD were included as surrogate end points. 
Fractures in adults age â‰¥50 years were assumed to be fragility fractures
 unless at the ankle, hands and feet, skull and face,19 or as a result 
of high-intensity trauma.Study selectionFollowing
 removal of duplicates, two review authors (NW and EH) independently 
selected eligible studies and achieved consensus on which articles to 
include. Publications investigating interventions commonly undertaken by
 non-physician HPs were included even if the professional group 
delivering the intervention was not specifically stated or non-physician
 HPs were not sole providers. Articles were excluded if published in 
languages other than English.  Systematic reviews and randomised 
controlled trials (RCTs) were preferentially selected, although (quasi) 
randomised and non-randomised studies were included. Systematic reviews 
with sufficient quality were considered to cover the time until their 
search ended. Studies with small sample sizes (50% of the population had at least one fragility fracture, 
the study was allocated to question 2; if â‰¤50%, the study was allocated 
to question 3. If more than one published article reported data from a 
single cohort, the most up-to-date publication was included in the 
analysis.","### Q16:

Search A systematic search in PubMed and EMBASE was performed on 2 May 2014 for studies investigating IR for CCTA without a publication date limitation. English language restriction was applied. Synonyms for â€œIR techniquesâ€ and â€œCTâ€ were combined. The search syntax is provided in Appendix A. Duplicates were removed. Hereafter, a manual search of the reference lists of included articles and review articles was performed after which review articles were removed. Inclusion and exclusion criteria All articles were screened by two authors (AH and MW). In case of discrepancy, a consensus had to be reached between authors on whether to include the study. Original research articles concerning IR techniques for CCTA using prospective ECG triggering were included. Studies comparing routine dose acquisitions with FBP to reduced dose acquisitions with IR using the same CT system, contrast medium and dose modulation techniques were included, whereas studies investigating only one dose level without comparison to FBP were excluded. Furthermore, studies only investigating non-enhanced CCTA, ex vivo, in vitro and animal studies as well as studies performed in children were excluded. Case reports and reviews were excluded as well. Case reports were defined as studies including less than five patients. Data extraction Data were extracted to a standardized data sheet, which included first author, title, publication date, journal, study design, participant characteristics, reconstruction technique, scan indication, type of scan, type of CT system, and reported dose and image quality measurements. The primary outcome was the effective dose reduction with IR. The effective dose was calculated as the doseâ€“length product (DLP) times the conversion factor for chest CT (0.014 mSvmGy21 cm21).10 This conversion factor was chosen because it was the most commonly used conversion factor in the included articles. In case a different conversion factor was used, the effective dose was recalculated using the DLP. If the effective dose was reported without conversion factor or DLP, the corresponding author was contacted. The corresponding authors were also contacted if both the effective dose and the DLP were not reported. Secondary outcome was the influence of IR on objective and subjective image quality. Noise, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were investigated. Image quality was specified as improved, equal or deteriorated compared with FBP. Improved was defined as a statistically significant improvement of image quality with IR compared with FBP. Non-significant differences were classified as the same, and a significant decrease in image quality was classified as deteriorated. If multiple IR levels were studied, the IR level with the most favourable outcome was used for further analysis. From each article, the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the effective dose were extracted. If only the median and the interquartile range (IQR) were reported, the mean and SD  were recalculated. The median was considered to be equal to the mean if the number of patients exceeded 25.11 The IQR was converted to the SD using the formula 1.353SD5IQR. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SPSSÂ® v. 20.0 (IBM Corp., New York, NY; formerly SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) [for MicrosoftÂ® WindowsÂ® (Microsoft, Redmond, WA)] and the RStudio statistical environment v. 0.98.1025 (RStudio, Inc., 2009â€“13) with â€œmetaâ€ package v. 3.7-1.12 For every study, a mean and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. Heterogeneity was assessed by the I2 statistic, and random effect models were used in case of large interstudy variance (I2$65%). Results were presented as mean with 95% CI. Both the normal dose data with FBP and the reduced dose data with IR were calculated and pooled. A two-tailed p-value",False,1,1,True

For the conduct of this systematic review, we followed the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses 
(PRISMA) statement (Shamseer et al., 2015). With the assistance of a 
library scientist, we searched for randomized trials indexed from 1980 
to May 11, 2017 in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, MEDLINE 
inprocess, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, 
CINAHL, and PsychINFO. The search strategy included Medical Subject 
Heading terms and text words that identified patients with cancer or 
HSCT recipients who received an intervention to reduce fatigue. Appendix
 A shows the full search strategies.2.1. Study selectionEligibility
 criteria were defined a priori. We included studies if participants of 
any age had cancer or were HSCT recipients, and if the study was a fully
 published primary randomized or quasi-randomized trial with a parallel 
group design. The study had to evaluate an intervention for the 
prevention or treatment of fatigue. We excluded studies if less than 75%
 of participants had cancer or were undergoing HSCT; if fatigue was 
either not an end-point or reported as an adverse effect; if the 
intervention was direct cancer treatment; and if less than five 
participants were randomized to any study arm. We did not restrict 
inclusion by language. For the purpose of this systematic review, we 
then limited studies to those in which non-physical activity mind and 
body practices were the intervention being evaluated.Two 
reviewers (SO, PDR or LS) independently evaluated the titles and 
abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy. Any publication 
considered potentially relevant by any reviewer was retrieved in full 
and assessed for eligibility by two reviewers (SO, PDR or LS). Inclusion
 of studies in this systematic review was determined by agreement of 
both reviewers. Discrepancies between the two reviewers were resolved by
 consensus and adjudication by a third reviewer if required (LLD or LS).
 Agreement in study inclusion between the two reviewers was described 
using the kappa statistic. Strength of agreement was defined as slight 
(0.00â€“0.20), fair (0.21â€“0.40), moderate (0.41â€“0.60), substantial 
(0.61â€“0.80), or almost perfect (0.81â€“1.00) (Koch et al., 1977).2.2. Data abstraction and outcomesData
 were abstracted in duplicate by two reviewers (ND, HD or PDR) and any 
discrepancies were resolved by consensus. If discrepancies could not be 
resolved by consensus, a third reviewer (LS) adjudicated. We contacted 
authors in the event of missing primary outcome data.The 
primary outcome was self-reported fatigue severity across the fatigue 
scales used in the primary studies. For studies that used more than one 
fatigue scale, we selected one scale to be used for analyses based upon 
an a priori developed rule. We selected the most prevalent fatigue scale
 used across studies (see Appendix B).2.3. Categorization of non-physical activity mind and body practice interventions and control groupsThe
 interventions were non-physical activity mind and body practices. 
Practices were classified as: (1) acupuncture and acupressure; (2) 
mindfulness (practice of enhancing awareness of thoughts, emotions, and 
experiences) (Anonymous, 2017a); (3) relaxation techniques (such as 
progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery); (4) massage 
therapies; (5) energy therapies (including Reiki, therapeutic touch, and
 healing touch) (Anonymous, 2017b); (6) energizing yogic breathing; and

Data on inclusion and exclusion criteria
for screening and laboratory data were collected. Biochemical analyses for
diagnostic purposes included AGAL-A enzyme activity in leucocytes, plasma and
serum. In all cases, the enzyme assay for AGAL-A as described by Mayes et al18
was used. In screening studies, the source of enzyme was either plasma, serum
or dried blood spots (DBS). In conï¬rmatory studies, mostly leukocytes were
used. While a deï¬ciency of AGAL-A can be reliably established with all enzyme
sources, leukocytes are clearly superior to estimate residual AGAL-A
activities. Therefore, only leukocyte data were used in our study for
estimating the residual activities. Nevertheless, caution should be taken when
this assay is used to estimate the true residual activity in vivo since the
contribution of AGAL-B may not always be completely suppressed in the assay and
the artiï¬cial substrate has different properties than the natural substrate.
Reference values for healthy controls and cut-off values for positively
screened individuals were collected. 
 Additionally, the results of molecular
analysis of the GLA gene were recorded. We registered the total number of
individuals in the screening study, the number of positively screened
individuals in the ï¬rst screening test, and the number of true and false
positives after the conï¬rmatory test. All data were speciï¬ed for males and females
if available. For all true positives the following characteristics were
collected: gender, age, GLA genotype, residual GLA enzyme activity (plasma,
leukocyte and serum), lysoGb3 and the presence of phenotypic FD characteristics
angiokeratoma, acroparesthaesia and/or cornea verticillata. Anhidrosis was not

We searched Medline, Embase and the
Cochrane controlled trials register from inception to July 2014 using the terms
â€˜gastroschisisâ€™, â€˜gastroschisis and siloâ€™, â€˜preformed siloâ€™ and â€˜silastic
siloâ€™. Abstracts of the unï¬ltered literature were reviewed and full text
versions of selected publications were assessed for inclusion. Reference lists
of these publications were also checked to identify additional relevant
reports. The literature search, assessment for inclusion and data extraction
were performed independently by three reviewers and disagreements resolved by
consensus.
Studies were selected for inclusion in the review if they reported
comparative outcomes between infants treated with a PFS and infants treated
with an alternate treatment strategy. Studies were excluded if they reported a
cohort of infants treated only with a PFS with no comparative group, reported a
cohort of infants treated with a PFS grouped with infants treated with another
treatment strategy such as a hand-sewn silo, originated from a non-developed
country or were not in English. For infants treated with a PFS no selection was
made on the basis of ï¬nal technique of abdominal wall closure (i.e. all were
included).
All outcomes were selected a priori. The
primary outcome measure was time on a ventilator. Secondary outcomes were
number of infants never ventilated, time on parenteral nutrition (PN), time to
achieve full enteral feeds, length of hospital stay, incidence of necrotizing
enterocolitis, number of unplanned re-operations, infectious complications,
mortality and occurrence of ventral hernia following repair.
Where studies reported outcomes of more
than two treatment types (e.g. PFS, primary closure and staged closure using a
handsewn silo), we selected the group undergoing primary closure as the
comparator group and excluded the other group(s) from the analysis.
Data were extracted and entered into Review
Manager (v5.1, The Cochrane Collaboration) and meta-analysis was performed
using a random effects model due to variation in study design and reporting.
Summary statistics for continuous variables are reported as mean difference
(MD) with 95 % conï¬dence interval (95 % CI) and dichotomous variables as risk
difference (RD) with 95 % CI in order to allow inclusion of studies with zero events
[8]. An I2 statistic for heterogeneity was calculated for each pooled dataset.
For the purposes of meta-analysis continuous data are required to be in the
format of mean and standard deviation (SD). For studies that only reported
median and range, mean and SD were estimated using validated formulae
speciï¬cally developed for this purpose [9].
We anticipated a large proportion of the
data available would arise from retrospective cohort studies. Our a priori
intention was therefore to perform subgroup analysis that included only studies
reporting pre-planned management strategies for gastroschisis. Only studies
that used an intended policy to treat all infants routinely with a PFS unless
clinically contra-indicated were included in this subgroup analysis. If it was
unclear whether such a policy existed then it was assumed that none did and the
study was excluded from this subgroup analysis. The subgroup analysis therefore
allows a comparison of outcomes based on an â€˜intention to treatâ€™ all infants in
the PFS group with a PFS unless clinically contra-indicated.

Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (registration number:  CRD42018096969). No ethics committee approval
or informed consent was required since this was a retrospective analysis of
previously published studies.
Data Sources and Search Strategy
An extensive, unrestricted, computerized
MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library literature search of articles in English
and French was independently conducted by 2 reviewers (J.A., L.D.) according to
prespeciï¬ed selection criteria from inception to April 3, 2018. We also
considered studies selected from prior meta-analyses related to the impact of
MRAs on AF occurrence6,7; trial protocols on trial registry platforms,
including clinicaltrials.gov ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/), the World Health
Organizationâ€™s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform
( http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/), the UK Clinical Trials Gateway ( https://www.ukctg.nihr.ac.uk/),
and EudraCT ( https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/); and data from scientiï¬c meeting
abstracts and conferences. We used both controlled terms (ie, MeSH terms in
MEDLINE) and free-text terms related to MRAs as domain 1 (details of the search
are provided in Figure 1). Regarding domain 2 (AF domain), as we did not expect
that AF would be reported often in study titles or abstracts (because AF is
often a secondary end point of MRA studies), we did not create a speciï¬c search
domain using the free term â€œAFâ€ to avoid restricting search strategy.
Therefore, we computed a larger domain using the terms â€œcardiovascular diseaseâ€
OR â€œheart diseaseâ€ OR â€œatrial ï¬brillationâ€ (domain 2). The ï¬nal research was
performed as follows: (domain 1) AND (domain 2). Second, a manual search was
performed for relevant references from the selected articles.
Study Selection
Studies evaluating the effects of MRAs
(study intervention) compared with non-MRA drugs (placebo or other control
drugs, study comparator) on AF occurrence in adult patients were included.
Studies using comparators other than drugs were not included. Clinical trials
(randomized or nonrandomized, parallel arm, and cluster designs) and clinical
observational comparative studies (including retrospective or prospective
cohorts and case-control or nested case-control designs) reporting any AF
outcomes and the use of MRAs were included. We excluded cross-sectional
studies, case series, crossover studies, and case reports. Healthcare/health
insurance database studies were also excluded because this type of database
does not offer much valuable clinical information to allow the conduct of
subgroup and meta-regression analyses.
Data Extraction
Two review authors (J.A., L.D.)
independently screened study titles and abstracts identiï¬ed by the search
against eligibility criteria. Full reports were obtained for all eligible
articles/abstracts. The review authors independently extracted data from the
selected studies in duplicate using a standardized data extraction form. Any
disagreements were resolved by consensus with senior authors (J.J.P., P.M.).

### Q16_just:
In accordance with NICE methodology, the review question was developed in consultation with stakeholder groups and then refined by the Guideline Committee using the PICO (population, intervention, comparison and outcome) frame-work for intervention reviews to guide the literature searching process, critical appraisal and evidence synthesis [60]. Systematic literature searches were undertaken to identify health economic evidence within published literature relevant to the review question. The searches were conducted in the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), the Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA) and the Health Economic Evaluations Database (HEED) (NHS EED ceased to be updated after March 2015; HEED was used for searches up to December 2014 but subsequently ceased to be available). Additionally, searches were run on MEDLINE and EMBASE using a health economic evaluation filter. Where possible, searches were restricted to papers published in English; studies published in languages other than English were not reviewed. Initial searches were run up to December 2016 and then updated on 23 March 2018. No paper published after this date was considered. The search strategies are included in Online Resource 1. Study selection was undertaken first by one of the authors (DD) sifting through the titles and abstracts of the retrieved records in accordance with the inclusion/exclusion criteria (listed below) and then being independently checked by another author (AH). Differences in opinion were resolved through discussions among the two authors. If a consensus was not reached, the opinion of a more senior health economist (DW) was sought and the decision discussed with the community pharmacy expert on the committee (MV), the guideline committee chair (JB) and the deputy chair (PD). 2.1  Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria The key population inclusion criterion was:   â€¢       adults (18  years of age and over) and young people (16â€“17  years of age) who are at risk of, and those who seek or are referred for, emergency NHS care for a suspected or confirmed acute illness, including medical emergencies.   â€¢      children   â€¢       people with acute obstetric emergencies   â€¢       people with acute mental health emergencies, once a diagnosis had been made   â€¢       people with acute surgical emergencies, once a diagnosis had been made   â€¢       people who had experienced major trauma, complex or non-complex fractures or spinal injury   â€¢       people in hospital who were not there for an acute medical emergency (i.e. elective admissions) and who did not develop an acute medical emergency during their stay    â€¢       people already in hospital with acute deterioration people with chronic conditions who were being managed as outpatients but who required an elective admission for treatment from specialists involved in the acute pathway.    The key study inclusion criterion was that the study had to be a full economic evaluation (studies comparing costs and health consequences of alternative courses of action: cost-utility, cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit and cost-con-sequences analyses). Comparative costing studies that addressed the review question in the relevant population were also considered for inclusion. Studies that only reported cost per hospital (not per patient), or only reported average cost effectiveness with-out disaggregated costs and effects, were excluded, as were literature reviews, conference abstracts, posters, letters, editorials, comment articles and unpublished studies. Studies published before 2005 and studies from non-OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries or the US were also excluded on the basis that the applicability of such studies to the present UK NHS context was likely to be too low to inform the guideline commit-teeâ€™s decision making. In addition, studies not published in English were excluded. The remaining health economic studies were prioritised for inclusion based on their relative applicability and the study limitations. The hierarchies used to guide this prioritisation process are listed in Table  1, which presents the review protocol. The categories for the assessment of applicability and methodological quality are illustrated in Table  2, and the criteria used are listed in the NICE economic evaluation checklist available in Appendix H of the NICE Guidelines Manual ( https://www.nice.org.uk/process/pmg20/resources/appendix-h-pdf-2549710190) [60]. The main criteria for judging the applicability are related to the nature of the population, the intervention, the perspective, and the method used for measuring and valuing health outcomes. The criteria used for judging methodological quality include time horizon, source of efficacy estimates, source of baseline risks, source of unit costs and assessment of uncertainty. Data from the included studies, including country, population, study design, intervention(s) and comparator, follow-up, costs and cost categories, outcomes and source of effectiveness evidence, incremental costs, incremental effects and conclusion regarding cost effectiveness, were extracted in standard evidence tables by one of the authors (DD). Where costs were reported in currencies other than UK Pounds Sterling (GBP), conversion was undertaken using the OECD purchasing power parity conversion rates for the corresponding cost year. Costs were not inflated.",False,1,1,True

retrieved, to identify other relevant studies.Data extractionFollowing exclusion of
duplicate studies, all titles and abstracts were screened independently by two
authors, using the following inclusion criteria:â€¢   â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ â€ population â€” patients presenting

The methodology described by the Cochrane Collaboration was employed in this systematic review [9]. This research was approved by the ethics committee of the federal university of SÃ£o Paulo - Unifesp - CAAE: 57099216.0.0000.5505. Criteria for considering studies for this review Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated different ventilation strategies for obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery, under general anesthesia, regardless of age and gender, were included. Obesity was defined as BMI greater than 30 Kg/m2 [10]. Primary outcomes: in hospital mortality, adequacy of intra-operative gas exchange, pulmonary mechanics (plateau pressure, mean airway pressures, lung compliance and lung resistance) alteration. Secondary outcomes: Intraoperative and postoperative respiratory complications such barotrauma, hemodynamic instability, pneumonia, atelectasis, reintubation, self-extubation and the need for noninvasive mechanical ventilation measured in hours or days; cardiovascular responses; need for hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU) and length of stay (LOS) in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Search methods for identification of studies Searches (see attachment) were performed in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE via Ovid (1966 to present); old MEDLINE (1951 to present); and EMBASE via Ovid (January 1990 to present), without language or location restrictions. The highly sensitive Cochrane filter for randomized controlled trials was applied to the MEDLINE and EMBASE searches. Trial registers such as www.clinicaltrials.gov and the Current Controlled Clinical Trials Website ( http://www.controlled-trials.com/) were also searched for ongoing trials. Data collection and analysis Two authors (GMCS and SAZ) independently screened all the potential studies identified and coded them as â€˜retrieveâ€™ (eligible or potentially eligible/unclear) or â€˜do not retrieveâ€™. The full-text reports/publications were then retrieved and two authors independently screened the full text and identified the studies for inclusion. Disagreements were resolved through discussion or if required consultation with a third author. Duplicates were excluded and multiple reports of the same study were collated so that each study, rather than report, is the unit of interest in the review. The selection process was recorded in appropriate detail, as set out in the complete PRISMA flow diagram [11]. The authors were contacted and additional details were requested. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by involving a third author. Assessment of risk of bias in the included studies Risk of bias was assessed at study level using Cochraneâ€™s â€˜Risk of Biasâ€™ tool [12]. Two review authors (GMCS and SAZ) independently assessed the methodologic quality of each study included and resolved their disagreements by discussion. Data synthesis To consider the measures of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes, the total number of events within each randomized group were entered and the risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. For data presented in other forms, such as odds or hazard ratios, the generic variance option was used, although different effect measures (odds, risk or hazard ratios) were not combined in the same model. Mean differences were calculated for continuous outcomes measured on the same scale in different studies. Assessment of heterogeneity Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated by assessing forest plots and examining the I2 value, which describes the proportion of total variation across studies caused by heterogeneity rather than chance [9]. An I2 value greater than 50% was considered as the cut-off point to identify the presence of considerable heterogeneity [9].",False,0,1,False

We aimed to identify and appraise the up-to date scientific literature 
about the effect of non-pharmacological interventions delivered by 
non-physician HPs to prevent and manage osteoporotic fracture in 
high-risk adults, age 50 years or more. High risk of osteoporotic 
fracture was categorised using BMD values for low bone mass (osteopenia)
 and osteoporosis specified by WHO,15 and/or short-term probability of 
fracture. The definition we used for high-risk adults is detailed in 
table 1.The aim of this SLR was to inform an international EULAR 
taskforce on a broad range of issues related to non-physician HPsâ€™ 
interventions. Non-physician HPs deliver different interventions in 
different countries. Therefore, we focused our review on interventions 
that could potentially be delivered by non-physician HPs, independent of
 whether a study was led by a non-physician HP or not.A SLR for each
 of eight clinical questions (table 2), formulated and consensually 
agreed by the taskforce, was undertaken by a research fellow (NW) with 
guidance from the taskforce convenors (EH, JA) and a methodologist 
(TAS). The methods for each SLR, including the research question and 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, were agreed on and documented within a 
joint taskforce meeting. The taskforce comprised 2 patient research 
partners, 1 dietitian, 1 geriatrician and 1 nurse, 3  occupational 
therapists, 2 orthopaedic surgeons, 4 physiotherapists, 1 specialist in 
physical medicine and rehabilitation and 5 rheumatologists, drawn from 
10 European countries.The conduct of the review was informed by
 Cochrane principles.16 A Participants, Interventions, Comparisons, 
Outcomes and Study design approach17 was adopted for each question 
followed by a systematic search across international electronic 
databases  (Medline/PubMed, Embase and Cumulative Index to Nursing and 
Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) for relevant literature published 
between January 2007 and October 2017 (online supplementary file 1). 
Searches were based on two critieria: (1) adultsâ‰¥50 years of age at high
 risk of primary or secondary osteoporotic fracture and (2) 
interventions delivered by non-physician HPs to prevent and manage 
osteoporotic fractures. Interventions included diagnostic procedures to 
identify risk of falling, therapeutic approaches (eg, structured 
exercise, education, falls prevention programmes) and implementation 
strategies. Key outcomes were fractures and falls (where the accepted 
definition of a fall was an unexpected event in which the participants 
come to rest on the ground, floor or lower level18). High risk of 
falling and change in BMD were included as surrogate end points. 
Fractures in adults age â‰¥50 years were assumed to be fragility fractures
 unless at the ankle, hands and feet, skull and face,19 or as a result 
of high-intensity trauma.Study selectionFollowing
 removal of duplicates, two review authors (NW and EH) independently 
selected eligible studies and achieved consensus on which articles to 
include. Publications investigating interventions commonly undertaken by
 non-physician HPs were included even if the professional group 
delivering the intervention was not specifically stated or non-physician
 HPs were not sole providers. Articles were excluded if published in 
languages other than English.  Systematic reviews and randomised 
controlled trials (RCTs) were preferentially selected, although (quasi) 
randomised and non-randomised studies were included. Systematic reviews 
with sufficient quality were considered to cover the time until their 
search ended. Studies with small sample sizes (50% of the population had at least one fragility fracture, 
the study was allocated to question 2; if â‰¤50%, the study was allocated 
to question 3. If more than one published article reported data from a 
single cohort, the most up-to-date publication was included in the

For the conduct of this systematic review, we followed the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses 
(PRISMA) statement (Shamseer et al., 2015). With the assistance of a 
library scientist, we searched for randomized trials indexed from 1980 
to May 11, 2017 in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, MEDLINE 
inprocess, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, 
CINAHL, and PsychINFO. The search strategy included Medical Subject 
Heading terms and text words that identified patients with cancer or 
HSCT recipients who received an intervention to reduce fatigue. Appendix
 A shows the full search strategies.2.1. Study selectionEligibility
 criteria were defined a priori. We included studies if participants of 
any age had cancer or were HSCT recipients, and if the study was a fully
 published primary randomized or quasi-randomized trial with a parallel 
group design. The study had to evaluate an intervention for the 
prevention or treatment of fatigue. We excluded studies if less than 75%
 of participants had cancer or were undergoing HSCT; if fatigue was 
either not an end-point or reported as an adverse effect; if the 
intervention was direct cancer treatment; and if less than five 
participants were randomized to any study arm. We did not restrict 
inclusion by language. For the purpose of this systematic review, we 
then limited studies to those in which non-physical activity mind and 
body practices were the intervention being evaluated.Two 
reviewers (SO, PDR or LS) independently evaluated the titles and 
abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy. Any publication 
considered potentially relevant by any reviewer was retrieved in full 
and assessed for eligibility by two reviewers (SO, PDR or LS). Inclusion
 of studies in this systematic review was determined by agreement of 
both reviewers. Discrepancies between the two reviewers were resolved by
 consensus and adjudication by a third reviewer if required (LLD or LS).
 Agreement in study inclusion between the two reviewers was described 
using the kappa statistic. Strength of agreement was defined as slight 
(0.00â€“0.20), fair (0.21â€“0.40), moderate (0.41â€“0.60), substantial 
(0.61â€“0.80), or almost perfect (0.81â€“1.00) (Koch et al., 1977).2.2. Data abstraction and outcomesData
 were abstracted in duplicate by two reviewers (ND, HD or PDR) and any 
discrepancies were resolved by consensus. If discrepancies could not be 
resolved by consensus, a third reviewer (LS) adjudicated. We contacted 
authors in the event of missing primary outcome data.The 
primary outcome was self-reported fatigue severity across the fatigue 
scales used in the primary studies. For studies that used more than one 
fatigue scale, we selected one scale to be used for analyses based upon 
an a priori developed rule. We selected the most prevalent fatigue scale
 used across studies (see Appendix B).2.3. Categorization of non-physical activity mind and body practice interventions and control groupsThe
 interventions were non-physical activity mind and body practices. 
Practices were classified as: (1) acupuncture and acupressure; (2) 
mindfulness (practice of enhancing awareness of thoughts, emotions, and 
experiences) (Anonymous, 2017a); (3) relaxation techniques (such as 
progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery); (4) massage 
therapies; (5) energy therapies (including Reiki, therapeutic touch, and
 healing touch) (Anonymous, 2017b); (6) energizing yogic breathing; and 
(7) others. We categorized the duration of the intervention based upon 
the median duration of all interventions as","### Q17:

This systematic review complied with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (Table S1).9 The protocol was prospectively registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (registration number: CRD42018096969). No ethics committee approval or informed consent was required since this was a retrospective analysis of previously published studies.Data Sources and Search StrategyAn extensive, unrestricted, computerized MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library literature search of articles in English and French was independently conducted by 2 reviewers (J.A., L.D.) according to prespeciï¬ed selection criteria from inception to April 3, 2018. We also considered studies selected from prior meta-analyses related to the impact of MRAs on AF occurrence6,7; trial protocols on trial registry platforms, including clinicaltrials.gov ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/), the World Health Organizationâ€™s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/), the UK Clinical Trials Gateway ( https://www.ukctg.nihr.ac.uk/), and EudraCT ( https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/); and data from scientiï¬c meeting abstracts and conferences. We used both controlled terms (ie, MeSH terms in MEDLINE) and free-text terms related to MRAs as domain 1 (details of the search are provided in Figure 1). Regarding domain 2 (AF domain), as we did not expect that AF would be reported often in study titles or abstracts (because AF is often a secondary end point of MRA studies), we did not create a speciï¬c search domain using the free term â€œAFâ€ to avoid restricting search strategy. Therefore, we computed a larger domain using the terms â€œcardiovascular diseaseâ€ OR â€œheart diseaseâ€ OR â€œatrial ï¬brillationâ€ (domain 2). The ï¬nal research was performed as follows: (domain 1) AND (domain 2). Second, a manual search was performed for relevant references from the selected articles.Study SelectionStudies evaluating the effects of MRAs (study intervention) compared with non-MRA drugs (placebo or other control drugs, study comparator) on AF occurrence in adult patients were included. Studies using comparators other than drugs were not included. Clinical trials (randomized or nonrandomized, parallel arm, and cluster designs) and clinical observational comparative studies (including retrospective or prospective cohorts and case-control or nested case-control designs) reporting any AF outcomes and the use of MRAs were included. We excluded cross-sectional studies, case series, crossover studies, and case reports. Healthcare/health insurance database studies were also excluded because this type of database does not offer much valuable clinical information to allow the conduct of subgroup and meta-regression analyses.Data ExtractionTwo review authors (J.A., L.D.) independently screened study titles and abstracts identiï¬ed by the search against eligibility criteria. Full reports were obtained for all eligible articles/abstracts. The review authors independently extracted data from the selected studies in duplicate using a standardized data extraction form. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus with senior authors (J.J.P., P.M.).

Search strategyWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to
December 2015 using a sensitive search strategy combining the following Medical
Subject Headings (MESHs) and keywords: haemorrhage, bleed, invasive procedure,
surgery, general surgery, surg*, emergencies, procedure, warfarin,
acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, vit-amin K antagonist, blood component transfusion,
plasma, fresh frozen plasma, blood coagulation factors, coagulants, prothrombin
complex concentrate, prothrombin, factor X, factor IX, factor VII, factor II, beriplex,
kcentra, confidex, octaplex and profilnine. A manual review of reference lists
was also conducted. Potential sources of unpublished data were searched
through www.clinical trials.gov up to December 2015.The methods and outcomes were
reported according to PRISMA recommendations (18). The study protocol was
registered with PROSPERO Trial Registration (#CRD42015017383).Study selectionTwo reviewers (CC and CH)
independently performed study selection using pre-specified inclusion and
exclusion criteria. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational
studies (prospective or retrospective) were eligible, with no language
restriction. We included studies that investigated adult patients (aged 18
years or older) who presented with warfarin associated major bleeding, or
those who required urgent warfarin reversal for surgery or an invasive
procedure. We selected only studies comparing PCC (either 3F- or 4F-PCC) to
FFP. Studies that evaluated a combination of PCCs and FFP or factor VIIa as a
co-intervention were excluded. If the same patients were used in multiple
studies, we chose the study with the largest sample size or most complete
out-come report. Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by consensus or
a third reviewer (MC).Data extractionData were extracted
independently by two reviewers (CC and CH) using a standardised data record
form. The following information was extracted and recorded: first author, year
of publication, inclusion criteria, study design, mean or median age of
participants, sex, indications for anticoagulant therapy, bleeding site, type
of surgery (procedure), type and dose of PCC, dose of FFP and du-ration of
follow-up. Discrepancies between the reviewers resolved by consensus or a third
reviewer (MC).OutcomesThe primary outcome
was all-cause mortality at 30 days. We chose the 30-day period because this
reflects the efficacy and safety of re-versal agents during bleeding and surgical
events. Delayed deaths beyond this point are more likely to be associated with
causes un-related to warfarin reversal treatment choice. The secondary
out-comes were volume overload, thromboembolic events, haemostasis, speed of
INR reduction, proportion of patients who achieved INR correction and red blood
cell (RBC) transfusion.Risk of bias assessmentThe methodological
quality of the randomized studies was evaluated independently by two reviewers
(CC and RM) using the Cochrane Collaborationâ€™s Risk of Bias tool (19),
scoring each study for: random sequence generation, allocation concealment,
method of blinding, completeness of data, selective outcome reporting and
other risks of bias. Each parameter was judged as a high, low or unclear risk
of bias. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or through a third reviewer
(MC).The quality of the observational studies was assessed using A Cochrane
Risk of Bias Assessment Tool: for Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions
(ACROBAT-NRSI) (20). We evaluated the risk of bias based on confounding,
selection of participants, measurement of the interventions, departures from
intended intervention, missing data, measurement of outcomes and selection of
the reported results. Each outcome was judged as a low, moderate, serious,
critical and no information.We generated funnel plots of effect size versus
standard error of effect estimates in order to assess for potential publication
bias. Publication bias was considered to be present if the funnel plots were asymmetrical.Data synthesisTo
compare differences between categorical outcomes between PCC and FFP, we generated
pooled odd ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CIs)
using a Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model (21). Pooled results of
continuous outcomes were summarised using mean difference (MD) and corresponding
95 % CI. Heterogeneity was classified based on a scale of I2: contributory
(I2 = 0â€“30 %), moderate (I2= 30â€“50 %), substantial (I2= 50â€“75 %) and considerable
(I2 > 75 %) (21). A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant
for all tests. Absolute risk reduction (ARR) and number needed to treat were
calculated. We performed a priori subgroup analysis according to indication
for warfarin reversal (major bleeding or urgent surgery or invasive procedure)
and type of PCC (3F- and 4F-PCC). Sensitivity analyses were carried out for
study design (randomised controlled studies or observational studies). We
reanalysed the data when removing study with high risk of bias. In addition, all
analyses were repeated with fixed-effect modelling. The main analysis was
performed using Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.3 (Copenhagen: The Nordic
Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014).Trial sequential analysisTo
address possible Type I (random) error and ensure adequate meta-analysis
information size (22, 23), we constructed a trial sequential analysis for the
three clinically relevant outcomes (all-cause mortality, congestive heart
failure/volume overload and thromboembolic events). We calculated the required
information size (meta-analysis sample size) for the primary out-come based on
an assumption of a plausible reduction in the relative risk of all-cause
mortality from the pooled estimates (30 %) when the patients received PCC as
compared with FFP given a baseline mortality rate of 13 % (1), type I error of
5 % and type II error of 20 %. For this analysis, the trial sequential
monitoring boundaries for benefit and harm were constructed. We used TSA
software version 0.9 beta (available on http://ww.ctu.dk/tsa/).Assessment of the quality of
the evidences across studiesWe assessed the quality of the body of
evidence from the included studies using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool (24). The quality of the evidence for

### Q17_just:
The risk of bias in each individual study
was examined based on the PEDro Scale developed by the Center for Evidence
Based Practice in Australia [21, 22]. The PEDro Scale has shown moderate to
high levels of interrater reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)
0.54â€“0.91; [21]). With the PEDro Scale, the following indicators of
methodological rigor were scored independently as either absent or present (0
or 1): (1) specification of eligibility criteria, (2) random allocation, (3)
concealed allocation, (4) prognostic similarity at baseline, (5) subject blinding,
(6) therapist blinding, (7) assessor blinding, (8) greater than 85% follow-up
for at least 1 key outcome, (9) intention-to-treat analysis, (10) between-group
statistical analysis for at least 1 key outcome, and (11) point estimates of
variability provided for at least 1 key outcome. According to the PEDro
guidelines, criteria (2) through (11) are used for scoring purposes so that a
score from 0 to 10 can be obtained [23]. Studies scoring 9 or 10 were rated as
excellent, 6 to 8 as good, 4 to 5 as fair, and lower than 4 as poor [24]. Table
2 shows the PEDro scores for the 10 included articles. 
 In addition to the PEDro scale, the quality
of the studies was rated according to the Sackettâ€™s levels of evidence [25],
which was adapted to include PEDro scaling. According to this quality
assessment method, evidence level of 1a (strong) was given when two or more
high quality RCTs were showing similar results (PEDro â‰¥ 6); evidence level of
1b (moderate) was given when at least one RCT of high quality was found (PEDro
= 6); evidence level of 2a (limited) was given when at least one fair quality
RCT was found (PEDro 4-5); evidence level of 2b (limited) was given when at
least one poor quality RCT or well-designed nonexperimental study was found
(PEDro < 4); evidence level of 3 (consensus) was given when a number of
pre-post studies showed similar results or there was an agreement by an expert
panel; evidence level of 4 (conflict) was given when there was a conflicting
evidence of two or more equally well designed studies; finally, evidence level
of 5 was given when no well-designed study was found.","### Q17:

To assess the risk of bias across studies, we evaluated
each retrieved article and identified any drop-outs or missing data as
reported by the authors. In addition, for all three outcomes, we divided the
articles as being conducted either early or late after stroke. We chose
acut-off of 6months for early/late, a sit has been observed that motor
function recovery is most rapid during the first month after stroke, becomes
slow during subsequent months, and eventually goes to a plateau phase by 6
months after stroke [20]. Therefore we separated the acute and subacute stages
(before 6 months) from the chronic stage (after 6 months), as the chance of
recovery during the chronic stage is lower. Finally, for the subluxation
outcome, in addition to investigating the short-term effects of FES therapy by
evaluating the changes at the end of the intervention period, we also estimated
the long-term effects by performing a separate qualitative evaluation on those
studies that carried out a follow-up assessment after the cessation of
treatment.The risk of bias in each individual study was examined based

Search strategy
A comprehensive literature search of PubMed was
conducted between 28 May and 4 June 2018. Three search strings were formulated
related to BMI and obesity (â€œbody mass indexâ€, â€œBMIâ€, â€œobesityâ€, â€œobeseâ€, â€œbody
weightâ€, â€œweight lossâ€, â€œweight gainâ€), ALS (â€œALSâ€, â€œAmyotrophic lateral sclerosisâ€)
and â€œmotor neuron diseaseâ€ (see Supplementary Table S2). No publication date restriction
was imposed. Reference lists of retrieved studies were also searched manually
to identify additional studies.
Eligibility criteria
Articles were included in the meta-analysis if
they satisfied the following criteria: (1) quantitatively comparative design
involving consecutive patients; (2) patients were diagnosed with definite,
probable, probable (laboratory-supported), or possible ALS according to the El
Escorial revised criteria (20), without restrictions on gender, age or other major
patient characteristics; (3) impact of BMI or obesity was analyzed
independently of other comorbidities; (4) the primary outcome was overall survival
(OS), and adequate data were reported to estimate odds ratios (ORs), relative
risks (RRs) and hazard ratios (HRs); and (5) studies were published as
full-text articles in peer-reviewed English-language journals.
Case studies, reviews, preclinical experiments,
conference abstracts and letters were excluded. If studies involved overlapping
study populations, only the most recent study was included.
Data collection
The following data were extracted from included
studies into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet: authors, publication year, country
of origin, study design, study period, sample size, gender composition, age,
BMI cutoff for the definition of obesity, score on the ALS functional rating
scale-revised (ALSFRS-R), length of follow-up, outcome measures and data,
statistical methods, and results of tests. Studies were categorized according

The meta-analysis was performed following PRISMA guidelines12.
Search and inclusion criteria
We conducted an electronic search without language restrictions using
MEDLINE/PubMed, the Cochrane library, ISI Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL and
the US National Institutes of Health clinical trials registry
( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). The following search terms were used:
antipsychotic(s); neuroleptic(s); individual names of SGAs; schizophrenia;
random, randomly, randomized; and maintenance, relapse, discontinuation or
long-term. The last search was done on October 29, 2018. The electronic search
was supplemented by a hand search of reference lists of relevant studies and
reviews. Authors and companies were contacted to provide missing information
and unpublished data.
We included randomized, head-to-head comparisons of oral SGAs in adults with
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder which reported on treatment
discontinuation, whether randomization occurred during the acute or maintenance
phase. As we aimed to focus on the comparative long-term effectiveness of SGAs,
we only included head-to-head studies lasting â‰¥6 months.
We excluded studies with >20% of non-schizophrenia/schizoaffective
disorder patients. As long-acting injectable formulation enhances the adherence
and therefore has a significant impact on long-term outcome13, 14, we excluded
studies on long-acting antipsychotics.
The search, selection of the literature, and data extraction were conducted
independently by â‰¥2 reviewers (KH, MN, TK, CC). Disagreements were resolved by
consensus.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was all-cause discontinuation at study endpoint.
Secondary outcomes included: a) psychopathology score change, measured by
the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Brief Psychiatric Rating
Scale (BPRS) or the Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) score (mixed
models or last-observation-carried-forward was prioritized over observed cases
analysis); b) inefficacy-related discontinuation (as reported by the original
study authors); c) intolerability-related discontinuation (as reported by the
original study authors); d) relapse (as reported by the original study
authors); e) hospitalization; f) remission (as reported by the original study
authors); g) functioning score; h) quality of life (QOL); and i) adverse
events.
Adverse events included: weight gain (as change from baseline or proportion
of patients with clinically significant increase); prolactin increase (as
change from baseline or proportion of patients with hyperprolactinemia);
neuromotor adverse effects, including parkinsonism assessed with the Simpson-Angus
Rating Scale or use of anticholinergics, akathisia and dyskinesia; and sedation
and/or somnolence.
Data analysis
SGAs were compared individually for each outcome. We applied a
â€œonce-randomized-analyzedâ€ intent-to-treat (ITT) endpoint analysis. In studies
that followed patients even after they were switched off the originally
allocated medication during the study period, we analyzed the primary outcome
based only on the first medication but, for secondary outcomes, we extracted
and analyzed the data as reported in the ITT sample.
Pooled risk ratio (RR) and standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models15. RR
values 1 indicate
superiority for the only positive outcome, remission. For simplicity we

Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (registration number:  CRD42018096969). No ethics committee approval
or informed consent was required since this was a retrospective analysis of
previously published studies.
Data Sources and Search Strategy
An extensive, unrestricted, computerized
MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library literature search of articles in English
and French was independently conducted by 2 reviewers (J.A., L.D.) according to
prespeciï¬ed selection criteria from inception to April 3, 2018. We also
considered studies selected from prior meta-analyses related to the impact of
MRAs on AF occurrence6,7; trial protocols on trial registry platforms,
including clinicaltrials.gov ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/), the World Health
Organizationâ€™s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform
( http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/), the UK Clinical Trials Gateway ( https://www.ukctg.nihr.ac.uk/),
and EudraCT ( https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/); and data from scientiï¬c meeting
abstracts and conferences. We used both controlled terms (ie, MeSH terms in
MEDLINE) and free-text terms related to MRAs as domain 1 (details of the search
are provided in Figure 1). Regarding domain 2 (AF domain), as we did not expect
that AF would be reported often in study titles or abstracts (because AF is
often a secondary end point of MRA studies), we did not create a speciï¬c search
domain using the free term â€œAFâ€ to avoid restricting search strategy.
Therefore, we computed a larger domain using the terms â€œcardiovascular diseaseâ€
OR â€œheart diseaseâ€ OR â€œatrial ï¬brillationâ€ (domain 2). The ï¬nal research was
performed as follows: (domain 1) AND (domain 2). Second, a manual search was
performed for relevant references from the selected articles.
Study Selection
Studies evaluating the effects of MRAs
(study intervention) compared with non-MRA drugs (placebo or other control
drugs, study comparator) on AF occurrence in adult patients were included.
Studies using comparators other than drugs were not included. Clinical trials
(randomized or nonrandomized, parallel arm, and cluster designs) and clinical
observational comparative studies (including retrospective or prospective
cohorts and case-control or nested case-control designs) reporting any AF
outcomes and the use of MRAs were included. We excluded cross-sectional
studies, case series, crossover studies, and case reports. Healthcare/health
insurance database studies were also excluded because this type of database
does not offer much valuable clinical information to allow the conduct of
subgroup and meta-regression analyses.
Data Extraction
Two review authors (J.A., L.D.)
independently screened study titles and abstracts identiï¬ed by the search
against eligibility criteria. Full reports were obtained for all eligible
articles/abstracts. The review authors independently extracted data from the
selected studies in duplicate using a standardized data extraction form. Any
disagreements were resolved by consensus with senior authors (J.J.P., P.M.).
The j statistic revealed excellent agreement between the 2 review authors

To assess the risk of bias across studies, we evaluated
each retrieved article and identified any drop-outs or missing data as reported
by the authors. In addition, for all three outcomes, we divided the articles as
being conducted either early or late after stroke. We chose acut-off of 6months
for early/late, a sit has been observed that motor function recovery is most
rapid during the first month after stroke, becomes slow during subsequent
months, and eventually goes to a plateau phase by 6 months after stroke [20].
Therefore we separated the acute and subacute stages (before 6 months) from the
chronic stage (after 6 months), as the chance of recovery during the chronic
stage is lower. Finally, for the subluxation outcome, in addition to
investigating the short-term effects of FES therapy by evaluating the changes
at the end of the intervention period, we also estimated the long-term effects
by performing a separate qualitative evaluation on those studies that carried
out a follow-up assessment after the cessation of treatment.
The risk of bias in each individual study was examined
based on the PEDro Scale developed by the Center for Evidence Based Practice in
Australia [21, 22]. The PEDro Scale has shown moderate to high levels of
interrater reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) 0.54â€“0.91;
[21]). With the PEDro Scale, the following indicators of methodological rigor
were scored independently as either absent or present (0 or 1): (1)
specification of eligibility criteria, (2) random allocation, (3) concealed
allocation, (4) prognostic similarity at baseline, (5) subject blinding, (6)
therapist blinding, (7) assessor blinding, (8) greater than 85% follow-up for

Study selectionThe inclusion criteria were defined as follows: 1) a study involving the role of YKL-40 in COPD designed as a cohort study or caseâ€“control study; 2) if there was duplication of data, only the most complete and recent study was included; and 3) a primary study provided available data for counting standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI).The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) the study was not designed as a cohort study or caseâ€“control study; 2) a study did not provide available data for counting effect size or was missing other essential information; and 3) review, abstract, or overlapping study.Study quality score evaluationThe qualities of identified studies involving the role of YKL-40 in COPD were evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), and the scale to investigate quality was based on three aspects: selection, comparability, and exposure in the primary study. The total score ranged from 0 to 9 (0â€“3, 4â€“6, and 7â€“9 was considered low-, moderate-, and high-quality, respectively). The quality of the studies was assessed in a consensus meeting with all authors.Data extractionTwo independent authors (Xiang Tong and Dongguang Wang) extracted the detailed information and data from each primary study using a predesigned data extraction Excel form. If there was any disagreement or doubt, the third author (Sitong Liu) further reviewed these articles. The information and data extraction included the following: first author, year of publication, ethnicity, age of participant, serum, and sputum YKL-40 levels, correlation coefficient (r), sample size of patients and controls, and Fisherâ€™s Z-value, and method of YKL-40 measurement. If a study only provided medians and ranges (or interquartile ranges [IQR]), we transformed the data to approximate means and standard deviations following the validated methods proposed by Wan et al.16 Additionally, if the Fisherâ€™s Z-value could not be directly obtained from the publication, Fisherâ€™s r-to-Z transformation was used to convert each correlation coefficient into their approximately associated Z statistics, which is considered the normal distribution.17Statistical methodsIn the present study, all data analyses were performed using STATA 12.0 and SPSS 21.0 software. After appropriate conversion, we chose the random-effect model to synthesize data from the various studies because it is thought to be more conservative, incorporates better between-study variance terms, and produces a lower type I error rate as well as a wider CI for the pooled effects estimate when compared with the fixed-effect model.18The SMD with 95% CI was used to compare the levels of serum or sputum YKL-40 in the COPD patients with the levels in healthy population. Regarding the pooled correlation coefficient, we used Fisherâ€™s Z-value to calculate the related statistic (summary Z-value) and 95% CI by the methods described in the previous study, and then transferred them back to summary effect size (summary r-value) using Fisherâ€™s Z-to-r transformation procedure.17The between-study heterogeneity was investigated by the chi-squared-based Q-test and I-squared (I2) statistics test. A P-value of â€“control study; 2) a study did not provide available data for counting effect size or was missing other essential information; and 3) review, abstract, or overlapping study.Study quality score evaluationThe qualities of identified studies involving the role of YKL-40 in COPD were evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), and the scale to investigate quality was based on three aspects: selection, comparability, and exposure in the primary study.

If there was any disagreement or doubt, the third author (Sitong Liu) further reviewed these articles. The information and data extraction included the following: first author, year of publication, ethnicity, age of participant, serum, and sputum YKL-40 levels, correlation coefficient (r), sample size of patients and controls, and Fisherâ€™s Z-value, and method of YKL-40 measurement. If a study only provided medians and ranges (or interquartile ranges [IQR]), we transformed the data to approximate means and standard deviations following the validated methods proposed by Wan et al.16 Additionally, if the Fisherâ€™s Z-value could not be directly obtained from the publication, Fisherâ€™s r-to-Z transformation was used to convert each correlation coefficient into their approximately associated Z statistics, which is considered the normal distribution.17Statistical methodsIn the present study, all data analyses were performed using STATA 12.0 and SPSS 21.0 software. After appropriate conversion, we chose the random-effect model to synthesize data from the various studies because it is thought to be more conservative, incorporates better between-study variance terms, and produces a lower type I error rate as well as a wider CI for the pooled effects estimate when compared with the fixed-effect model.18The SMD with 95% CI was used to compare the levels of serum or sputum YKL-40 in the COPD patients with the levels in healthy population. Regarding the pooled correlation coefficient, we used Fisherâ€™s Z-value to calculate the related statistic (summary Z-value) and 95% CI by the methods described in the previous study, and then transferred them back to summary effect size (summary r-value) using Fisherâ€™s Z-to-r transformation procedure.17The between-study heterogeneity was investigated by the chi-squared-based Q-test and I-squared (I2) statistics test.

Two review 
authors (HD, GD) independently and blindly screened the titles and 
abstracts of all the records identified by the search strategy, in 
accordance with the Cochrane recommendations.19 For this initial 
screening, all search results were imported into reference management 
software and duplicates were removed. The screening process assessed 
whether the citation: (1) reported data from an original research study 
using HCMs and (2) focused on cardiac arrest or cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation. If both criteria were met, the study was considered 
eligible. The two review authors rated each citation using a â€œrelevantâ€,
 â€œirrelevantâ€ or â€œunsureâ€ designation. Only full-text articles that 
received a â€œrelevantâ€ or â€œunsureâ€ classification from at least one of 
the two review authors were retrieved for citations. Out of 244 records 
identified, discrepancies of eligibility assessment between authors were
 encountered for 14 references. Full-text articles of records identified
 as being potentially relevant were independently assessed by the two 
authors for inclusion. Disagreementson eligibility were resolved in 
discussion between the reviewers. The reasons for excluding studies were
 recorded. A PRISMA-style flow diagram was drawn to illustrate the 
process of primary study selection from identification to inclusion in 
thesystematic review (Fig. 1).The following data were collected 
for each study eligible when available: the type of cadaver and its 
characteristics and the intended purpose of the study. We also reported 
if chest compressions were applied and their modalities, if ventilation 
was performed, if declotting or perfusion techniques were used and if 
any other kind of equipment was used on the cadaver. Finally, we looked for any mention of the modelâ€™s quality assessment or limitations reported in those studies. To
 provide an overview of the quality level of the studies included, we 
used the Cochrane RoB Tool developed by the Cochrane Collaboration20 to 
report the risk of bias (Appendix B). This tool evaluates seven 
different quality domains: (1) random sequence generation, (2) 
allocation concealment, (3) blinding of participants and personnel, (4) 
blinding of outcome assessment, (5) incomplete outcome data, (6) 
selective reporting and (7) other biases. The Cochrane RoB Tool was 
developed for randomised clinical trials and is not completely adequate 
for studies on cadaver models which include experimental studies. This 
means that some aspects of the quality assessment process needed
 to be adapted to the characteristics of the studies using HCMs. When 
the risk of bias for a specific domain was considered irrelevant in a 
given study by the authors, it was graded as â€œlowâ€. We graded as 
â€œunclear risk of other biasesâ€ studies lacking a description of the 
modelâ€™s characteristics, preparation or storage conditions in a way 
resulting in non-reproducible study conditions.","### Q19:

2.1. Study design and search strategy
Reporting in line with PRISMA guidelines (www.prisma-statement.org) and through consultation with subject specific and systematic review experts the literature review methodology was developed. The literature search was performed across a variety of databases (Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS and AMED) encompassing publications within the years of 1980-January 2014.

2.2. Study selection
One reviewer (SF), who had received training on database searching, completed all searches which were independently checked by a second author (LB). Differences of opinion were resolved through discussion or a third author. Citation checking and search of grey literature, including key conference proceedings within the last 3 years was also undertaken. Authors were subsequently contacted to determine if any relevant proceedings had since reached publication.
Inclusion criteria were determined a priori. Studies were required to assess gait characteristics between footwear in terms of spatial-temporal variables, kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity and behaviour. Participants were to be healthy and able to ambulate independently such that their gait pattern was considered normal and would not influence comparisons between footwear conditions. They could be of any age group and either gender to observe any differences throughout age and include data from both males and females to draw comparisons from if possible. Overground walking and treadmill walking were both deemed acceptable in order to access all studies analysing barefoot walking gait characteristics. Studies of observational cross-sectional design were included to allow for review of the comparison between footwear conditions wear inclusive of socks, open-toe footwear such as sandals or flip-flops and slippers. Observational comparative studies were deemed suitable if they were comparing between habitually barefoot, who have grown up and continue to live without wearing shoes, and habitually shod, who wear shoes on a day-to-day basis, populations to determine changes which occur over long term use with or without shoes. Case-control studies were also included providing the control group fitted the participant criteria and data was available for conclusions to be drawn solely from this group with regard to footwear intervention. If both groups fitted the participant criteria, then providing that data was available these were included and comparisons were focussed on the separate group's response to the footwear intervention rather than the comparisons between groups.
Studies were excluded if the footwear included any interventions aside from the features included in the original footwear design such as separate insoles or orthotics. Any studies involving participants who required a walking aid to ambulate were also excluded along with participants who had a known previous or current gait disorder or condition that could influence their gait (unless the study also consists of a control group through which analysis can be drawn from). Studies were excluded if they used running, unless a walking test was also completed from which analysis could be solely focussed. Literature other than peer-reviewed journal articles and comparative studies were excluded from the review.
2.3. Data collection and items
Using a standardised form the lead reviewer independently extracted the data. Study characteristics included repeated measures designs between various footwear conditions and between subject comparisons in terms of habitual barefoot and habitual shod users. Included outcomes were any measures which assessed spatial-temporal, kinematic, kinetic or muscle activity/behaviour variables.
2.4. Risk of bias across studies
To assess the methodological quality a bespoke critical appraisal tool was developed based upon the STROBE Checklist [3] for reporting observational studies and the CASP appraisal tool [1]. All articles were assessed on these questions which determine if all the required steps for successful scientific reporting were taken and if the relevant information is presented clearly in the scientific paper. A score of 1 was given for each question if the article satisfied the question and a 0 given if it failed to do so. A total score out of 20 was then given for each paper. The quality assessment of the selected studies was carried out by one reviewer (SF) and then repeated independently by a second author (LB). Any issues were discussed to achieve consensus of opinion.
2.5. Synthesis of results
It was not appropriate to combine studies for meta-analysis, therefore the results were tabulated for semi quantitative comparison of spatial-temporal, kinematic, kinetic and muscle activity/behaviour variables.",False,1,1,True

If studies evaluating the same outcome measure were sufficiently homogenous concerning the study population, design, and measurement procedure, an overall rating, adjusted for methodological quality, was performed. The best evidence synthesis included only results from studies rated as being of â€œexcellent,â€ â€œgood,â€ or â€œfairâ€ methodological quality on the COSMIN. The level of overall evidence was rated on the basis of the strategy from the Cochrane Back Review Group as â€œstrong,â€ â€œmoderate,â€ â€œlimited,â€ â€œconflicting,â€ or â€œunknownâ€","### Q20:

For the conduct of this systematic review, we followed the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses 
(PRISMA) statement (Shamseer et al., 2015). With the assistance of a 
library scientist, we searched for randomized trials indexed from 1980 
to May 11, 2017 in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, MEDLINE 
inprocess, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, 
CINAHL, and PsychINFO. The search strategy included Medical Subject 
Heading terms and text words that identified patients with cancer or 
HSCT recipients who received an intervention to reduce fatigue. Appendix
 A shows the full search strategies.2.1. Study selectionEligibility
 criteria were defined a priori. We included studies if participants of 
any age had cancer or were HSCT recipients, and if the study was a fully
 published primary randomized or quasi-randomized trial with a parallel 
group design. The study had to evaluate an intervention for the 
prevention or treatment of fatigue. We excluded studies if less than 75%
 of participants had cancer or were undergoing HSCT; if fatigue was 
either not an end-point or reported as an adverse effect; if the 
intervention was direct cancer treatment; and if less than five 
participants were randomized to any study arm. We did not restrict 
inclusion by language. For the purpose of this systematic review, we 
then limited studies to those in which non-physical activity mind and 
body practices were the intervention being evaluated.Two 
reviewers (SO, PDR or LS) independently evaluated the titles and 
abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy. Any publication 
considered potentially relevant by any reviewer was retrieved in full 
and assessed for eligibility by two reviewers (SO, PDR or LS). Inclusion
 of studies in this systematic review was determined by agreement of 
both reviewers. Discrepancies between the two reviewers were resolved by
 consensus and adjudication by a third reviewer if required (LLD or LS).
 Agreement in study inclusion between the two reviewers was described 
using the kappa statistic. Strength of agreement was defined as slight 
(0.00â€“0.20), fair (0.21â€“0.40), moderate (0.41â€“0.60), substantial 
(0.61â€“0.80), or almost perfect (0.81â€“1.00) (Koch et al., 1977).2.2. Data abstraction and outcomesData
 were abstracted in duplicate by two reviewers (ND, HD or PDR) and any 
discrepancies were resolved by consensus. If discrepancies could not be 
resolved by consensus, a third reviewer (LS) adjudicated. We contacted 
authors in the event of missing primary outcome data.The 
primary outcome was self-reported fatigue severity across the fatigue 
scales used in the primary studies. For studies that used more than one 
fatigue scale, we selected one scale to be used for analyses based upon 
an a priori developed rule. We selected the most prevalent fatigue scale
 used across studies (see Appendix B).2.3. Categorization of non-physical activity mind and body practice interventions and control groupsThe
 interventions were non-physical activity mind and body practices. 
Practices were classified as: (1) acupuncture and acupressure; (2) 
mindfulness (practice of enhancing awareness of thoughts, emotions, and 
experiences) (Anonymous, 2017a); (3) relaxation techniques (such as 
progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery); (4) massage 
therapies; (5) energy therapies (including Reiki, therapeutic touch, and
 healing touch) (Anonymous, 2017b); (6) energizing yogic breathing; and 
(7) others. We categorized the duration of the intervention based upon 
the median duration of all interventions as","### MA:

We synthesized outcomes if there were at least three studies with outcome data within a stratum. Data were combined at the study level and not at the individual patient level. The severity of atigue was synthesized using the standardized mean difference (SMD) Effects were weighted by the inverse variance and a random effects model was used for all analyses as we expected heterogeneity between the studies. Statistical heterogeneity between trials was described using the I2 value The primary analysis compared all intervention groups against all control groups. Secondary analyses compared all interventions against usual care or wait list controls, and against sham controls. Sham controls were selected for subgroup analysis as they are most similar to placebo controls. Stratified analyses were then conducted that evaluated the effect of individual intervention groups against all controls and against sham controls. Sources of heterogeneity were explored using stratified analyses for the primary comparison, all interventions against all control groups, and for individual interventions which were effective in reducing fatigue.",False,1,1,True

After appropriate conversion, we chose the 
random-effect model to synthesize data from the various studies because 
it is thought to be more conservative, incorporates better between-study
 variance terms, and produces a lower type I error rate as well as a 
wider CI for the pooled effects estimate when compared with the 
fixed-effect model.18 The SMD with 95% CI was used to compare the levels
 of serum or sputum YKL-40 in the COPD patients with the levels in 
healthy population. Regarding the pooled correlation coefficient, we 
used Fisherâ€™s Z-value to calculate the related statistic (summary 
Z-value) and 95% CI by the methods described in the previous study, and 
then transferred them back to summary effect size (summary r-value) 
using Fisherâ€™s Z-to-r transformation procedure.17The between-study 
heterogeneity was investigated by the chi-squared-based Q-test and 
I-squared (I2) statistics test. A P-value of ,0.10 or an I2-value of 
.50% suggested a statistically significant heterogeneity. If a notable 
heterogeneity was found, we used a Kruskalâ€“Wallis test to directly 
compare the levels of serum YKL-40 in the COPD patients with the levels 
in controls and reported the results of this analysis as the median and 
IQR. Additionally, meta-regression analysis and sensitivity analysis 
were used to investigate the sources of heterogeneity. We further 
carried out subgroup analysis to determine the effect of status of 
disease (exacerbation vs stable).","### MA:

Literature searchWe performed a systematic literature search in the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Ovid Medline, Wanfang database (www.wanfangdata.com.cn), and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI, www.cnki.net) to identify studies involving the role of YKL-40 in patients with COPD, with the most recent search having been conducted on April 21, 2017. The key search terms were as follows: (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease OR COPD OR chronic airway inflammatory disease) AND (YKL-40 OR CHI3L1 OR HCgp-39 OR chitinase-3-like-1 protein OR human cartilage glycoprotein-39). The language was restricted to English or Chinese. Moreover, we conducted a web-based search in several commercial Internet search engines (such as Baidu Scholar and Google Scholar) using the same keywords. All analyses in the current meta-analysis were based on previously published studies; thus, no ethical approval and patient consent are required.Study selectionThe inclusion criteria were defined as follows: 1) a study involving the role of YKL-40 in COPD designed as a cohort study or caseâ€“control study; 2) if there was duplication of data, only the most complete and recent study was included; and 3) a primary study provided available data for counting standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) the study was not designed as a cohort study or caseâ€“control study; 2) a study did not provide available data for counting effect size or was missing other essential information; and 3) review, abstract, or overlapping study.Study quality score evaluationThe qualities of identified studies involving the role of YKL-40 in COPD were evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), and the scale to investigate quality was based on three aspects: selection, comparability, and exposure in the primary study. The total score ranged from 0 to 9 (0â€“3, 4â€“6, and 7â€“9 was considered low-, moderate-, and high-quality, respectively). The quality of the studies was assessed in a consensus meeting with all authors.Data extractionTwo independent authors (Xiang Tong and Dongguang Wang) extracted the detailed information and data from each primary study using a predesigned data extraction Excel form. If there was any disagreement or doubt, the third author (Sitong Liu) further reviewed these articles. The information and data extraction included the following: first author, year of publication, ethnicity, age of participant, serum, and sputum YKL-40 levels, correlation coefficient (r), sample size of patients and controls, and Fisherâ€™s Z-value, and method of YKL-40 measurement. If a study only provided medians and ranges (or interquartile ranges [IQR]), we transformed the data to approximate means and standard deviations following the validated methods proposed by Wan et al.16 Additionally, if the Fisherâ€™s Z-value could not be directly obtained from the publication, Fisherâ€™s r-to-Z transformation was used to convert each correlation coefficient into their approximately associated Z statistics, which is considered the normal distribution.17Statistical methodsIn the present study, all data analyses were performed using STATA 12.0 and SPSS 21.0 software.

Since the available evidence consists of a network of multiple RCTs involving treatments compared directly or indirectly or both, it was synthesised by means of a Bayesian MTC meta-analysis with linear and logistic regression models10,12,17,24. The analyses were performed for all treatments individually and for treatments by drug class. MTC within the Bayesian framework involve data, a likelihood distribution, a model with parameters, and prior distributions. The model relates the data from the individual studies to basic parameters reflecting the pooled relative treatment effects of each intervention compared to an overall reference treatment (i.e., placebo). Based on these basic parameters, the relative efficacy estimates between the TCF product and the competing interventions of interest were obtained according to functional relations between the basic parameters of each intervention (see Appendix for details). For each of the outcomes, a fixed-and a random-effects model was evaluated. With a fixed-effects model, it is assumed that there is no variation in relative treatment effects across studies for a particular pairwise comparison. However, if effect size estimates vary between studies to a greater extent than expected on the basis of chance alone, the studies are considered to be heterogeneous, and it is necessary to account for the extra variation, through use of a random-effects model. With a random-effects MTC model the heterogeneity is often assumed to be constant for all pair-wise comparisons. According to the â€˜goodness of fitâ€™ of the models, the random-effects model was the most appropriate approach for all analyses with the exception of the PASI 75 analysis by treatment. The Bayesian approach involves a formal combination of a prior probability distribution (that reflects a prior belief of the possible values of the basic parameters) with a (likelihood) distribution of the pooled effect based on the observed data to obtain a posterior probability distribution for the estimate of the basic parameters. In order not to influence the estimates by the choice of the prior distribution, a non-informative (i.e., â€˜flatâ€™) distribution was used for the parameters of the model. With such a prior distribution, results as reflected with the posterior distribution are solely driven by the data. The posterior distribution can be interpreted in terms of probabilities (e.g., â€˜There is an x% probability that treatment A results in a greater response than treatment Bâ€™). The posterior distribution is summarised with a point estimate reflecting the most likely value and the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile reflecting the 95% credible interval (CrI). In contrast to a 95% confidence interval obtained with a frequentist statistical analysis, the 95% CrI indicates the 95% probability that the â€˜trueâ€™ value lies in the interval18,20. The posterior distribution also allowed calculation of the probability that a certain treatment is best out of those compared, or second best, or third best, etc. Combining these results provides a rank ordering of the treatments regarding their efficacy estimates.

survival endpoints (overall survival [OS], disease-free survival [DFS],

2.1 Search Strategy and Study SelectionThe systematic review and meta-analysis on the role of miRNAs in melanoma were carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines [15]. The study search was carried out in bibliographic databases including EMBASE, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus and Web of science to identify relevant studies published between January 2011 and April 2018. A few studies were also obtained from the reference lists of these selected articles. Two authors (SS and MRM) performed the article search independently, and the corresponding author (RJ) performed a final review of the entire search and extracted articles.2.2 Selection CriteriaStudies included in our systematic review and meta-analysis were selected using the following inclusion and exclusion criteria.Inclusion criteria:1.  Studies that discussed the role of miRNAs and the survival outcome of melanoma patients.2.  Studies that reported HR and 95% CI values.3.  Articles published between 2012 and 2018.4.  Studies that interpreted survival analysis (clinical end-point) with univariate or multivariate analysis.5.  Studies that were in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analysis.6.  Studies with Kaplanâ€“Meier (KM) curves were also selected if it was possible to retrieve HR and 95% CI values from the KM curves.Exclusion criteria:1.  Conference abstracts, reviews and letters to the editor were not within the scope of our analysis.2.  Studies reporting in vitro, in silico and other non-human (animal) miRNA expression.3.  Unpublished articles/theses and incomplete studies.4.  Studies that discussed tumour histology, tumour differentiation and other malignant potential specifically if they failed to discuss the survival outcomes of miRNA in melanoma.5.  Articles that reported prognosis results for a sample size less than ten.2.3 Type of ParticipantsThis current study involves clinical data from the patient cohorts in the included studies that were identified through the online search. There were no limitations of gender, age, tumour stage, lymph nodes or any treatment parameters. Similarly, data on tissue, serum, skin lesions and plasma samples from the included studies were included in this study to investigate the expression of miRNAs in melanoma patients. The follow-up period was extracted from the included studies.2.4 Data Extraction and ManagementData were extracted from the included studies independently; any discrepancies were discussed amongst all authors, and the final decision was taken through a team decision. Using Microsoft ExcelÂ® (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA), data items were extracted after a manual check by the review team for evaluation of study quality and data synthesis. Data items such as author names, publication year, gender, study period, diagnostic methods, follow-up period, sunlight exposure, ulceration, TNM (tumour node metastasis) stages, endpoint determination, survival status and miRNA expressions were retrieved for further analysis. Endnote (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA) was used as a bibliographic reference manager to avoid duplication of the included studies.2.5 Quality Assessment and Risk of Bias of Individual StudiesTwo reviewers performed quality assessment of the included studies independently using the quality assessment tool from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI): Quality Assessment of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Quality Assessment Tool for observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies [16]. Before attempting to extract the data items from the individual studies, a quality assessment was performed. This assessment tool was applied to all the selected full-text articles, and they were then categorised into good, fair or poor. Fourteen elements of quality assessment, including patient population and selection, study comparability, follow-up and outcome of interest, are addressed by this tool [16]. The risk of bias is inversely correlated with the quality of the study. While a high risk of bias translates to a rating of poor quality, a low risk of bias translates to a rating of good quality. The name and version of the assessment tool used, the risk of bias graph/summary, incomplete outcome data and other potential sources of bias were also assessed. Data were summarised using descriptive statistics (frequency, percentage).2.6 Assessment of Heterogeneity and StatisticsComprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software (version 3.3.070; Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA) was used to perform the meta-analysis to generate forest plots using HRs and associated 95% CIs of survival endpoints (overall survival [OS], disease-free survival [DFS], recurrence-free survival [RFS], metastasis-free survival [MFS], progression-free survival [PFS] and post-recurrence survival [PRS]) from the selected studies. The pooled effect size estimate of the HR was estimated using random-effects model meta-analysis. The effect size of the HR on melanoma patients indicates the important aspects of the prognostic impact of miRNAs. The mean effect size of the HR is a crucial tool in reporting and interpreting the effectiveness of miRNAs on melanoma patientsâ€™ prognosis, generally referring to the comparative and collective effect size estimates of the different studies. The mean effect estimate of the HR is more frequently used in meta-analysis than its statistical significance or the sample size of the individual studies [17, 18]. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Higgins I2 statistic and Cochranâ€™s Q-test [19]. Cochranâ€™s Q-test was used secondary to the I2 statistic given its low power of heterogeneity detection. In case of any discrepancy, the I2 statistic was given precedence [20]. The forest plots were analysed to elucidate the outcomes of patient survival in melanoma. Subgroup analysis was carried out for the repeated miRNAs with the same methods for cumulative meta-analysis.2.7 Publication BiasPublication bias was estimated to assess any bias in the included studies. Funnel plots, Orwin and classic fail-safe N tests [21], Begg and Mazumdar Rank correlation tests [22], the Harbord-Eggerâ€™s test of the intercept [23] and Duval and Tweedieâ€™s trim and fill method [24] calculations were used.2.7.1 Funnel PlotsFunnel plots for each, study effect size about their sample size were constructed with scattered plots, where a lack of skew or asymmetry indicated an absence of publication bias.2.7.2 Classic Failâ€‘Safe and Orwin Failâ€‘Safe N TestsBoth the Orwin fail-safe N test and classic fail-safe N test were applied to determine studies that are missing from the systematic review and meta-analysis, even with the advent of complete online bibliographic searching. These tests help to enumerate the studies in a meta-analysis which transfers the effect size towards null and also makes it possible to interpret whether it is true or false [21].2.7.3 Begg and Mazumdar Rank Correlation TestThe Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation test uses the correlation between the ranks of effect sizes and the ranks of their variances. Inverse correlation may occur between study size and effect size due to the sizeable prognostic effects in melanoma patients. Therefore, we estimated the rank order correlation (Kendallâ€™s tau-b) between the prognostic effect and the standard error (which is driven primarily by sample size). Positive values indicate a trend towards a higher level of test accuracy in studies with smaller sample sizes [22].2.7.4 Eggerâ€™s Test of the InterceptThe Egger regression gives the degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from a regression of standard normal which deviates against precision [23]. This test was performed to determine whether there is an association between test accuracy estimates (estimate divided by its standard error) and their precision (reciprocal of the standard error of the estimate).2.7.5 Duval and Tweedieâ€™s Trim and Fill MethodA rank-based method was used to estimate the number of missing studies from the meta-analysis due to suppression of the most extreme results on one side of the funnel plot and to produce an adjusted estimate of test accuracy by inputting suspected missing studies. It initially trims the asymmetric studies from the right-hand side to locate the unbiased effect (in an iterative procedure), and then fills the plot by re-inserting the trimmed studies on the right and their input-ted counterparts to the left of the mean effect [24].",False,1,1,True

This systematic review and meta-analysis
was conducted according to established guidelines.20,21
Study Selection
We conducted a comprehensive search of
Pubmed (1946 to April 2017) and PsycInfo (1597 to April 2017) using terms (see
S-Table 1) related to prenatal, obesity, offspring and neurodevelopment. The
term â€˜neurodevelopmentalâ€™ included ASD, ADHD, cognitive and intellectual delay
and emotional/behavioral problems. We included observational studies
irrespective of publication status, language, sample size, follow-up duration
or BMI classification standard.
Three coders (CES, KR, AM) examined each
articleâ€™s title, abstract, and keywords from the search results. Each coder
worked independently to determine whether an article met inclusion criteria. If
disagreements between coders could not be resolved, the senior author (BFF) was
consulted. If relevant articles were misclassified during the initial coding
process, two other techniques (see below for more detail) were used to help
uncover the reports again. In total, 1483 abstracts were examined âˆ’ 57 (4%)
were deemed to meet inclusion criteria.
Two other types of searches were conducted
on any empirical study report and/or literature review that was determined to
be relevant. We examined reference lists of all reports that met inclusion
criteria to determine whether they cited any potentially relevant article
(backward search). We then conducted a cited reference search to determine
whether the reports that met inclusion criteria had been later cited by any potentially
relevant article (forward search). For backward and forward searches, titles
and abstracts were initially reviewed by the first author (CES), and if deemed
potentially relevant, the full-text was obtained. These search strategies
yielded an additional 6 reports.
To minimize publication bias, we contacted
authors whose articles reported maternal obesity and neurodevelopmental
outcomes but did not provide adjusted or unadjusted ORs, and requested raw data
so that we could calculate unadjusted ORs. For 12 articles (with publication
dates within the past 10 years), we received 4 responses that allowed us to
include the report in the meta-analysis and 2 responses that provided
information to include in the synthesis.
Data Extraction
Numerous characteristics of each study were
retrieved using a standardized data collection form. These characteristics
encompassed six broad domains: (a) the research report included basic
information about authorship and date of publication; (b) study characteristics
included information about the cohort, source of study population, and study
design; (c) quality indicators to assess observational studies
(see below); (d) sample information included demographic characteristics of the
cohorts; (e) outcome measures included information pertaining to the
neurodevelopmental outcomes and covariates; and (f) estimate of effect size
detailed the information needed to derive an unadjusted OR or adjusted OR and
95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Data extraction was completed by 4 reviewers
(CB, KR, AS, AM), with each article being independently coded twice. If there
was a discrepancy in coding, the two coders discussed each disagreement until
agreement was reached. If the disagreement could not be resolved, the first
author was consulted. This method results in high effective reliability.22
Quality assessmentâ€”A Quality Assessment
Scale was developed based on Tooth et al.23 and similar to Yu et al.24 (see
S-Table 2). We assessed the quality of all included studies based on 8
indicators: type of study, loss to follow-up, sample size, participant
selection, comparability of groups, statistical methods, criteria for
determining and categorizing pre-pregnancy weight, and measurement of
neurodevelopmental outcome. The quality of each study was classified as high
(>14), medium (11â€“14), or low ( 30 for
obese, reported in kg/m2 metric), although there were some exceptions. Three
articles grouped overweight and obese mothers together28â€“30; thus, these were
analyzed only as a combined obese and overweight category. Other articles
defined pre-pregnancy obesity as >30 BMI and all other participants were
defined as non-obese at","### MA:

Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (registration number:  CRD42018096969). No ethics committee approval
or informed consent was required since this was a retrospective analysis of
previously published studies.
Data Sources and Search Strategy
An extensive, unrestricted, computerized
MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library literature search of articles in English
and French was independently conducted by 2 reviewers (J.A., L.D.) according to
prespeciï¬ed selection criteria from inception to April 3, 2018. We also
considered studies selected from prior meta-analyses related to the impact of
MRAs on AF occurrence6,7; trial protocols on trial registry platforms,
including clinicaltrials.gov ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/), the World Health
Organizationâ€™s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform
( http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/), the UK Clinical Trials Gateway ( https://www.ukctg.nihr.ac.uk/),
and EudraCT ( https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/); and data from scientiï¬c meeting
abstracts and conferences. We used both controlled terms (ie, MeSH terms in
MEDLINE) and free-text terms related to MRAs as domain 1 (details of the search
are provided in Figure 1). Regarding domain 2 (AF domain), as we did not expect
that AF would be reported often in study titles or abstracts (because AF is
often a secondary end point of MRA studies), we did not create a speciï¬c search
domain using the free term â€œAFâ€ to avoid restricting search strategy.
Therefore, we computed a larger domain using the terms â€œcardiovascular diseaseâ€
OR â€œheart diseaseâ€ OR â€œatrial ï¬brillationâ€ (domain 2). The ï¬nal research was
performed as follows: (domain 1) AND (domain 2). Second, a manual search was
performed for relevant references from the selected articles.
Study Selection
Studies evaluating the effects of MRAs
(study intervention) compared with non-MRA drugs (placebo or other control
drugs, study comparator) on AF occurrence in adult patients were included.
Studies using comparators other than drugs were not included. Clinical trials
(randomized or nonrandomized, parallel arm, and cluster designs) and clinical
observational comparative studies (including retrospective or prospective
cohorts and case-control or nested case-control designs) reporting any AF
outcomes and the use of MRAs were included. We excluded cross-sectional
studies, case series, crossover studies, and case reports. Healthcare/health
insurance database studies were also excluded because this type of database
does not offer much valuable clinical information to allow the conduct of
subgroup and meta-regression analyses.
Data Extraction
Two review authors (J.A., L.D.)
independently screened study titles and abstracts identiï¬ed by the search
against eligibility criteria. Full reports were obtained for all eligible
articles/abstracts. The review authors independently extracted data from the
selected studies in duplicate using a standardized data extraction form. Any
disagreements were resolved by consensus with senior authors (J.J.P., P.M.).
The j statistic revealed excellent agreement between the 2 review authors

Search Strategy and Selection CriteriaWe performed a MEDLINE search of all articles until February 2010 and scientific session abstracts in the following journals: Circulation, Journal of the American College of Cardiology, European Heart Journal, and The American Journal of Cardiology. We also searched relevant websites including www.acc.org, www.americanheart.org, www.escardio.org, and www.clinicaltrialresults.org for the same information. No language, publication date, or publication status restrictions were imposed. We used the search terms â€˜â€˜extracardiac conduit Fontan,â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜thromboembolism,â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜stroke,â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜antiplatelet,â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜anticoagulation,â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜thrombus,â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜Fontan outcome,â€™â€™ and â€˜â€˜extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection.â€™â€™ The full search strategy is available on request from the authors. We identified additional references through a manual search of the bibliographies in retrieved articles.We obtained results from all articles on extracardiac Fontan procedure and included only articles that described primary ECC Fontan procedure, clearly reported patient selection, clearly reported anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy, enrolled al least five patients, and described a mean followup period of 2 months or longer. The exclusion criteria specified ongoing studies, irretrievable data, letters to the editor, editorials, reviews, case reports, and comment articles.Data Extraction and Quality AssessmentTwo investigators (C.M. and G.G.) independently reviewed reports for eligibility at the title and abstract levels, resolving divergences by consensus. Studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected for further analysis. Study quality was assessed by the following items: type of study (retrospective or prospective), patient enrollment, outcome assessment (both imaging and clinical evaluation or clinical examination alone), total number of patients lost to follow-up evaluation (less than 5%, more than 10%, or between 5 and 10%). However, we did not use a quality score because this practice remains controversial for observational studies [11].Data Synthesis and Statistical AnalysisWe analyzed the incidence of thromboembolic events, defined as stroke, pulmonary embolism, intracardiac or deep vein thrombosis, and reversible ischemic neurologic deficit occurring early or late after the ECC Fontan procedure. Early outcome was defined as outcome within the hospital or during the first 30 postoperative days. The j statistic was used to assess agreement between reviewers for study selection.We evaluated the incidence of thromboembolic and bleeding events, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), among patients undergoing the ECC Fontan procedure who received either antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulant regimen with or without antiplatelet agents. Summary event rates per group were calculated with a random-effect meta-analysis using the DerSimonian and Laird method. A z score was used to calculate the statistical significance of differences in thromboembolic rate according to the use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents. The Breslow-Day chi-square test was calculated to test the statistical evidence of heterogeneity across the studies (p\0.1). In addition, we used the I2 statistic, which describes the percentage variation across studies due to heterogeneity rather than chance. As a guide, I2 values less than 25% indicated low, values 25% to 50% indicated moderate, and values exceeding 50% indicated high heterogeneity. We assessed the possibility of small study effects by visual inspection of funnel plot asymmetry. Statistical analysis was performed with the Meta-Analyst beta 3.0 software program (Tufts Medical Center, Boston, US,  https://research.tufts-nemc.org/metaanalyst).The study was conducted in compliance with the Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) group [28].",False,1,1,True

Search strategy
A comprehensive literature search of PubMed was
conducted between 28 May and 4 June 2018. Three search strings were formulated
related to BMI and obesity (â€œbody mass indexâ€, â€œBMIâ€, â€œobesityâ€, â€œobeseâ€, â€œbody
weightâ€, â€œweight lossâ€, â€œweight gainâ€), ALS (â€œALSâ€, â€œAmyotrophic lateral sclerosisâ€)
and â€œmotor neuron diseaseâ€ (see Supplementary Table S2). No publication date restriction
was imposed. Reference lists of retrieved studies were also searched manually
to identify additional studies.
Eligibility criteria
Articles were included in the meta-analysis if
they satisfied the following criteria: (1) quantitatively comparative design
involving consecutive patients; (2) patients were diagnosed with definite,
probable, probable (laboratory-supported), or possible ALS according to the El
Escorial revised criteria (20), without restrictions on gender, age or other major
patient characteristics; (3) impact of BMI or obesity was analyzed
independently of other comorbidities; (4) the primary outcome was overall survival
(OS), and adequate data were reported to estimate odds ratios (ORs), relative
risks (RRs) and hazard ratios (HRs); and (5) studies were published as
full-text articles in peer-reviewed English-language journals.
Case studies, reviews, preclinical experiments,
conference abstracts and letters were excluded. If studies involved overlapping
study populations, only the most recent study was included.
Data collection
The following data were extracted from included
studies into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet: authors, publication year, country
of origin, study design, study period, sample size, gender composition, age,
BMI cutoff for the definition of obesity, score on the ALS functional rating
scale-revised (ALSFRS-R), length of follow-up, outcome measures and data,
statistical methods, and results of tests. Studies were categorized according
to whether they treated BMI as a continuous variable or dichotomous variable

### MA_just:
Meta-analysis with the random effect model was applied to combine the prevalence among studies. There was sensitivity and heterogeneity among studies. I2 and Q (P < 0.10) statistical tests were used to check out this heterogeneity (I2 static is percentage of observed total variation across studies that are due to heterogeneity rather than chance. It is calculated as I2 = 100% Ã— (Q âˆ’ df)/Q, where Q is Cochran's heterogeneity statistic and df degrees of freedom. Negative values of I2 are put equal to zero so that I2 lies between 0% and 100%. A value of 0% indicates no observed heterogeneity, and larger values show increasing heterogeneity. Q is the weighted of squares on a standardized scale. It is reported with a P value with low P values indicating the presence of heterogeneity. This test however is known to have low power to detect heterogeneity, and it is suggested to use a value of 0.01 as a cut of for significance. Conversely, Q has too much power as a test of heterogeneity if the number of studies is large. Subgroup analyses were assessed using Chi-square tests, and it was done for continents).

Meta-analyses were performed for pain and
physical function outcomes using two types of models.","### MA:
1

### MA_just:
For the primary efficacy outcomes (pain, physical function, physical quality of life, mental quality of life and sleep), we calculated an average change score by subtracting baseline from follow-up score and then dividing the result by the respective baseline score for the active treatment and placebo control groups. We abstracted data on the most commonly reported adverse events only, i.e., prevalence rate â‰¥15% in either the treatment or control arm. Dropout rates due to adverse events or lack of efficacy were recorded when present.
Data Synthesis for Meta Analyses Pain intensity was most often measured on a 0-10 scale, but sometimes on a 0-100 visual analog scale. Physical function was measured by WOMAC in all nine studies reporting this outcome, and quality of life was measured by the SF-36 instrument in the four studies with this outcome available to be included in the meta-analyses. Sleep quality was measured in a variety of ways. We used the overall measure of sleep where it was reported alone or, if not, other measures of sleep functioning.
Most studies reported mean outcomes with standard deviations or standard errors for placebo and active treatment either at baseline and follow up or at one of the 2 time points plus differences scores over time with standard errors for the difference. From these data, we derived for each study a 2Ã—2 set of variables (treatment by time); the 2 difference scores (follow up minus baseline) for placebo and active; and standard deviations for these 6 variables. For the dose-ranging studies (n=3), we examined the medication protocols and averaged the outcomes across the active treatment conditions (with pooled standard deviations) to provide a 2-level treatment variable comparable with the majority of studies that had only a single active treatment.
Statistical Models We carried out meta-analyses for pain and physical function outcomes using 2 types of models. The first was a statistical mixed model with treatment group (placebo versus active) and time of assessment (a repeated measure, baseline versus follow up) as fixed classification factors; the interaction of these 2 factors; and studies included in the model as levels of a random classification factor. The dependent variables were the outcome means (e.g., pain reduction) for the treatment and time groups divided by their standard deviations. Treatment effects across studies are tested by the interaction of treatment and time in this model.
The second model eliminated the repeated-measures factor for time of assessment and used the standardized mean difference over time (the mean difference divided by the standard deviation of the difference) as the dependent variable. The effect of opioids on the outcome is examined by the treatment main effect in this model. This model allowed inclusion of 2 additional studies in the analysis.
An examination of the results for pain and physical function outcomes revealed consistency between the 2 models, and only results from the second model using standardized difference scores are reported below.
Too few studies reported analysis for physical and mental quality of life and quality of sleep to include studies in the model as levels of a random factor (or to regard studies as fixed and include them in that way). For these outcomes, we carried out an analysis of the standardized difference scores in a model that included the fixed factor for treatments.
We also examined models in which additional independent variables were included. Pain type (osteoarthritis versus neuropathic), opioid potency (low/medium versus high), duration of action (short- versus long-acting agents), and whether the study allowed for co-analgesic use (yes versus no) were each included as additional fixed classification factors in the above models for pain and physical function (separate models for each additional variable). We focused on the interaction of these variables with treatment and time (or simply with treatment in the second basic model), as well as on the treatment contrasts at each level of the added variable. Methodologic quality score (entered as a quantitative variable) was examined as a covariate in the 2 basic models. To assess for age effects on treatment outcomes, mean participant age (range = 60-73) was entered as a covariate in both models. The homogeneity of the regressions of outcomes such as pain on age and on methodologic quality score were tested for treatment and timeâ€”i.e., the interaction of age and study quality with treatment and time.26
Most of the studies in the meta-analyses were not restricted to patients ages 65 or older and did not report results stratified by age. To augment the analysis of mean age described above, we also carried out an analysis limited to the studies that reported data specific to older age groups (i.e., those 65 years of age and older), comparing outcomes for older and younger age groups.
Two types of diagnostic analyses pertaining to the meta-analysis itself were carried out. Heterogeneity of treatment differences across studies, which may result from differences in study protocols, variable definitions, implementation, or overall quality, was tested by a standard statistic, Cochranâ€™s Q.27 The hypothesis of study homogeneity was rejected, indicating that mixed models (studies random) were more appropriate than fixed effect models. Mixed models are also preferable by general principles and for greater generalizability of results.
We also examined the question of publication biasâ€”whether there was a tendency in the sample of studies for there to be a lack of publication of certain types of studiesâ€”by a funnel plot with 1/(standard error), a measure of sample size, plotted against effect size.28",False,1,1,True

The
 incidence of PSC was summarized with an IR, which was defined as the 
number of cases in a population per 100,000 personyears at risk in the 
population. IRs adjusted for confounding factors were selected over 
unadjusted IRs. The standard errors (SEs) and 95% CIs for the IRs were 
estimated under the assumption of a Poisson distribution. The ratio of 
males to females was summarized with an IRR, which was defined as the IR
 of PSC in males over the IR of PSC in females. When the IRR was not 
reported but the number of male and female incident PSC cases and the 
total study population were included, the IRR was calculated under the 
assumption that the background population was 50% male. Heterogeneity 
was assessed with the Q statistic (5% level), and meta-analyses were 
performed with random-effects models because of the presence of

SearchA systematic search in PubMed and EMBASE was performed on 2 May 2014 for studies investigating IR for CCTA without a publication date limitation. English language restriction was applied. Synonyms for â€œIR techniquesâ€ and â€œCTâ€ were combined. The search syntax is provided in Appendix A. Duplicates were removed. Hereafter, a manual search of the reference lists of included articles and review articles was performed after which review articles were removed. Inclusion and exclusion criteriaAll articles were screened by two authors (AH and MW). In case of discrepancy, a consensus had to be reached between authors on whether to include the study. Original research articles concerning IR techniques for CCTA using prospective ECG triggering were included. Studies comparing routine dose acquisitions with FBP to reduced dose acquisitions with IR using the same CT system, contrast medium and dose modulation techniques were included, whereas studies investigating only one dose level without comparison to FBP were excluded. Furthermore, studies only investigating non-enhanced CCTA, ex vivo, in vitro and animal studies as well as studies performed in children were excluded. Case reports and reviews were excluded as well. Case reports were defined as studies including less than five patients.Data extractionData were extracted to a standardized data sheet, which included first author, title, publication date, journal, study design, participant characteristics, reconstruction technique, scan indication, type of scan, type of CT system, and reported dose and image quality measurements. The primary outcome was the effective dose reduction with IR. The effective dose was calculated as the doseâ€“length product (DLP) times the conversion factor for chest CT (0.014 mSvmGy21 cm21).10 This conversion factor was chosen because it was the most commonly used conversion factor in the included articles. In case a different conversion factor was used, the effective dose was recalculated using the DLP. If the effective dose was reported without conversion factor or DLP, the corresponding author was contacted. The corresponding authors were also contacted if both the effective dose and the DLP were not reported. Secondary outcome was the influence of IR on objective and subjective image quality. Noise, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were investigated. Image quality was specified as improved, equal or deteriorated compared with FBP. Improved was defined as a statistically significant improvement of image quality with IR compared with FBP. Non-significant differences were classified as the same, and a significant decrease in image quality was classified as deteriorated. If multiple IR levels were studied, the IR level with the most favourable outcome was used for further analysis. From each article, the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the effective dose were extracted. If only the median and the interquartile range (IQR) were reported, the mean and SDÂ were recalculated. The median was considered to be equal to the mean if the number of patients exceeded 25.11 The IQR was converted to the SD using the formula 1.353SD5IQR.Statistical analysisStatistical analysis was performed using SPSSÂ® v. 20.0 (IBM Corp., New York, NY; formerly SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) [for MicrosoftÂ® WindowsÂ® (Microsoft, Redmond, WA)] and the RStudio statistical environment v. 0.98.1025 (RStudio, Inc., 2009â€“13) with â€œmetaâ€ package v. 3.7-1.12 For every study, a mean and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated.

For the conduct of this systematic review, we followed the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses 
(PRISMA) statement (Shamseer et al., 2015). With the assistance of a 
library scientist, we searched for randomized trials indexed from 1980 
to May 11, 2017 in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, MEDLINE 
inprocess, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, 
CINAHL, and PsychINFO. The search strategy included Medical Subject 
Heading terms and text words that identified patients with cancer or 
HSCT recipients who received an intervention to reduce fatigue. Appendix
 A shows the full search strategies.2.1. Study selectionEligibility
 criteria were defined a priori. We included studies if participants of 
any age had cancer or were HSCT recipients, and if the study was a fully
 published primary randomized or quasi-randomized trial with a parallel 
group design. The study had to evaluate an intervention for the 
prevention or treatment of fatigue. We excluded studies if less than 75%
 of participants had cancer or were undergoing HSCT; if fatigue was 
either not an end-point or reported as an adverse effect; if the 
intervention was direct cancer treatment; and if less than five 
participants were randomized to any study arm. We did not restrict 
inclusion by language. For the purpose of this systematic review, we 
then limited studies to those in which non-physical activity mind and 
body practices were the intervention being evaluated.Two 
reviewers (SO, PDR or LS) independently evaluated the titles and 
abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy. Any publication 
considered potentially relevant by any reviewer was retrieved in full 
and assessed for eligibility by two reviewers (SO, PDR or LS). Inclusion
 of studies in this systematic review was determined by agreement of 
both reviewers. Discrepancies between the two reviewers were resolved by
 consensus and adjudication by a third reviewer if required (LLD or LS).
 Agreement in study inclusion between the two reviewers was described 
using the kappa statistic. Strength of agreement was defined as slight 
(0.00â€“0.20), fair (0.21â€“0.40), moderate (0.41â€“0.60), substantial 
(0.61â€“0.80), or almost perfect (0.81â€“1.00) (Koch et al., 1977).2.2. Data abstraction and outcomesData
 were abstracted in duplicate by two reviewers (ND, HD or PDR) and any 
discrepancies were resolved by consensus. If discrepancies could not be 
resolved by consensus, a third reviewer (LS) adjudicated. We contacted 
authors in the event of missing primary outcome data.The 
primary outcome was self-reported fatigue severity across the fatigue 
scales used in the primary studies. For studies that used more than one 
fatigue scale, we selected one scale to be used for analyses based upon 
an a priori developed rule. We selected the most prevalent fatigue scale
 used across studies (see Appendix B).2.3. Categorization of non-physical activity mind and body practice interventions and control groupsThe
 interventions were non-physical activity mind and body practices. 
Practices were classified as: (1) acupuncture and acupressure; (2) 
mindfulness (practice of enhancing awareness of thoughts, emotions, and 
experiences) (Anonymous, 2017a); (3) relaxation techniques (such as 
progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery); (4) massage 
therapies; (5) energy therapies (including Reiki, therapeutic touch, and
 healing touch) (Anonymous, 2017b); (6) energizing yogic breathing; and 
(7) others. We categorized the duration of the intervention based upon 
the median duration of all interventions as","### A:

Study Selection
We conducted a comprehensive search of
Pubmed (1946 to April 2017) and PsycInfo (1597 to April 2017) using terms (see
S-Table 1) related to prenatal, obesity, offspring and neurodevelopment. The
term â€˜neurodevelopmentalâ€™ included ASD, ADHD, cognitive and intellectual delay
and emotional/behavioral problems. We included observational studies
irrespective of publication status, language, sample size, follow-up duration
or BMI classification standard.
Three coders (CES, KR, AM) examined each
articleâ€™s title, abstract, and keywords from the search results. Each coder
worked independently to determine whether an article met inclusion criteria. If
disagreements between coders could not be resolved, the senior author (BFF) was
consulted. If relevant articles were misclassified during the initial coding
process, two other techniques (see below for more detail) were used to help
uncover the reports again. In total, 1483 abstracts were examined âˆ’ 57 (4%)
were deemed to meet inclusion criteria.
Two other types of searches were conducted
on any empirical study report and/or literature review that was determined to
be relevant. We examined reference lists of all reports that met inclusion
criteria to determine whether they cited any potentially relevant article
(backward search). We then conducted a cited reference search to determine
whether the reports that met inclusion criteria had been later cited by any potentially
relevant article (forward search). For backward and forward searches, titles
and abstracts were initially reviewed by the first author (CES), and if deemed
potentially relevant, the full-text was obtained. These search strategies
yielded an additional 6 reports.
To minimize publication bias, we contacted
authors whose articles reported maternal obesity and neurodevelopmental
outcomes but did not provide adjusted or unadjusted ORs, and requested raw data
so that we could calculate unadjusted ORs. For 12 articles (with publication
dates within the past 10 years), we received 4 responses that allowed us to
include the report in the meta-analysis and 2 responses that provided
information to include in the synthesis.
Data Extraction
Numerous characteristics of each study were
retrieved using a standardized data collection form. These characteristics
encompassed six broad domains: (a) the research report included basic
information about authorship and date of publication; (b) study characteristics
included information about the cohort, source of study population, and study
design; (c) quality 
indicators to assess observational studies
(see below); (d) sample information included demographic characteristics of the
cohorts; (e) outcome measures included information pertaining to the
neurodevelopmental outcomes and covariates; and (f) estimate of effect size
detailed the information needed to derive an unadjusted OR or adjusted OR and
95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Data extraction was completed by 4 reviewers
(CB, KR, AS, AM), with each article being independently coded twice. If there
was a discrepancy in coding, the two coders discussed each disagreement until
agreement was reached. If the disagreement could not be resolved, the first
author was consulted. This method results in high effective reliability.22
Quality assessmentâ€”A Quality Assessment
Scale was developed based on Tooth et al.23 and similar to Yu et al.24 (see
S-Table 2). We assessed the quality of all included studies based on 8
indicators: type of study, loss to follow-up, sample size, participant
selection, comparability of groups, statistical methods, criteria for
determining and categorizing pre-pregnancy weight, and measurement of
neurodevelopmental outcome. The quality of each study was classified as high
(>14), medium (11â€“14), or low ( 30 for
obese, reported in kg/m2 metric), although there were some exceptions. Three
articles grouped overweight and obese mothers together28â€“30; thus, these were
analyzed only as a combined obese and overweight category. Other articles
defined pre-pregnancy obesity as >30 BMI and all other participants were
defined as non-obese at","### A:

or informed consent was required since this was a retrospective analysis of
previously published studies.
Data Sources and Search Strategy
An extensive, unrestricted, computerized
MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library literature search of articles in English
and French was independently conducted by 2 reviewers (J.A., L.D.) according to
prespeciï¬ed selection criteria from inception to April 3, 2018. We also
considered studies selected from prior meta-analyses related to the impact of
MRAs on AF occurrence6,7; trial protocols on trial registry platforms,
including clinicaltrials.gov ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/), the World Health
Organizationâ€™s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform
( http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/), the UK Clinical Trials Gateway ( https://www.ukctg.nihr.ac.uk/),
and EudraCT ( https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/); and data from scientiï¬c meeting
abstracts and conferences. We used both controlled terms (ie, MeSH terms in
MEDLINE) and free-text terms related to MRAs as domain 1 (details of the search
are provided in Figure 1). Regarding domain 2 (AF domain), as we did not expect
that AF would be reported often in study titles or abstracts (because AF is
often a secondary end point of MRA studies), we did not create a speciï¬c search
domain using the free term â€œAFâ€ to avoid restricting search strategy.
Therefore, we computed a larger domain using the terms â€œcardiovascular diseaseâ€
OR â€œheart diseaseâ€ OR â€œatrial ï¬brillationâ€ (domain 2). The ï¬nal research was
performed as follows: (domain 1) AND (domain 2). Second, a manual search was
performed for relevant references from the selected articles.
Study Selection
Studies evaluating the effects of MRAs
(study intervention) compared with non-MRA drugs (placebo or other control
drugs, study comparator) on AF occurrence in adult patients were included.
Studies using comparators other than drugs were not included. Clinical trials
(randomized or nonrandomized, parallel arm, and cluster designs) and clinical
observational comparative studies (including retrospective or prospective
cohorts and case-control or nested case-control designs) reporting any AF
outcomes and the use of MRAs were included. We excluded cross-sectional
studies, case series, crossover studies, and case reports. Healthcare/health
insurance database studies were also excluded because this type of database
does not offer much valuable clinical information to allow the conduct of
subgroup and meta-regression analyses.
Data Extraction
Two review authors (J.A., L.D.)
independently screened study titles and abstracts identiï¬ed by the search
against eligibility criteria. Full reports were obtained for all eligible
articles/abstracts. The review authors independently extracted data from the
selected studies in duplicate using a standardized data extraction form. Any
disagreements were resolved by consensus with senior authors (J.J.P., P.M.).

Search Strategy and Selection CriteriaWe performed a MEDLINE search of all articles until February 2010 and scientific session abstracts in the following journals: Circulation, Journal of the American College of Cardiology, European Heart Journal, and The American Journal of Cardiology. We also searched relevant websites including www.acc.org, www.americanheart.org, www.escardio.org, and www.clinicaltrialresults.org for the same information. No language, publication date, or publication status restrictions were imposed. We used the search terms â€˜â€˜extracardiac conduit Fontan,â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜thromboembolism,â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜stroke,â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜antiplatelet,â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜anticoagulation,â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜thrombus,â€™â€™ â€˜â€˜Fontan outcome,â€™â€™ and â€˜â€˜extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection.â€™â€™ The full search strategy is available on request from the authors. We identified additional references through a manual search of the bibliographies in retrieved articles. We obtained results from all articles on extracardiac Fontan procedure and included only articles that described primary ECC Fontan procedure, clearly reported patient selection, clearly reported anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy, enrolled al least five patients, and described a mean followup period of 2 months or longer. The exclusion criteria specified ongoing studies, irretrievable data, letters to the editor, editorials, reviews, case reports, and comment articles.Data Extraction and Quality AssessmentTwo investigators (C.M. and G.G.) independently reviewed reports for eligibility at the title and abstract levels, resolving divergences by consensus. Studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected for further analysis. Study quality was assessed by the following items: type of study (retrospective or prospective), patient enrollment, outcome assessment (both imaging and clinical evaluation or clinical examination alone), total number of patients lost to follow-up evaluation (less than 5%, more than 10%, or between 5 and 10%). However, we did not use a quality score because this practice remains controversial for observational studies [11].Data Synthesis and Statistical AnalysisWe analyzed the incidence of thromboembolic events, defined as stroke, pulmonary embolism, intracardiac or deep vein thrombosis, and reversible ischemic neurologic deficit occurring early or late after the ECC Fontan procedure. Early outcome was defined as outcome within the hospital or during the first 30 postoperative days. The j statistic was used to assess agreement between reviewers for study selection.We evaluated the incidence of thromboembolic and bleeding events, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), among patients undergoing the ECC Fontan procedure who received either antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulant regimen with or without antiplatelet agents. Summary event rates per group were calculated with a random-effect meta-analysis using the DerSimonian and Laird method. A z score was used to calculate the statistical significance of differences in thromboembolic rate according to the use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents. The Breslow-Day chi-square test was calculated to test the statistical evidence of heterogeneity across the studies (p 50% indicated high heterogeneity.We assessed the possibility of small study effects by visual inspection of funnel plot asymmetry. Statistical analysis was performed with the Meta-Analyst beta 3.0 software program (Tufts Medical Center, Boston, US, https://research.tufts-nemc.org/metaanalyst).The study was conducted in compliance with the Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) group  [28].",False,1.0,1.0,True

intervention. Pooled standard deviation was also calculated using the 
following formula:where SEM = SD/âˆšsample size. Heterogeneity was 
assessed across studies using the diamond ratio (DR); a DR > 2 
implies considerable heterogeneity [22]. In the case of heterogeneity, a
 random-effects model was used. The meta-analysis was conducted for 
outcomes reported in a minimum of 3 studies, due to the potential for 
greater uncertainty with fewer studies [23]. The effect size (ES) of 
controlled studies was calculated, when possible, to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the IDE intervention. The reported ES was based on the 
relative size of Cohenâ€™s d, which categorizes the studies in the 
following four levels: d < 0.2 = negligible effect, over 0.2 = a 
small effect, over 0.5 = a medium effect, and over 0.8 = a large effect

Search StrategyWe conducted a systematic literature search with a predetermined protocol that was in accordance with the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) ,21 which studied the quality of reporting.21 We searched MEDLINE (1950 to June 2010) and Embase (1980 to June 2010) for studies investigating the incidence of PSC. The search strategy is outlined in detail in Appendix I.The search was not limited by language or to human subjects. The reference lists of relevant articles were also reviewed.Selection CriteriaTwo reviewers (N.A.M. and H.K.) identified articles eligible for further review by performing an initial screening of identified abstracts and titles. Abstracts were eliminated if they were not observational and did not investigate the epidemiology of PSC. Studies that did not report original data (e.g., review articles) were also excluded. The full text of the remaining articles was retrieved and systematically reviewed according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles were included if they reported an incidence rate (IR) of PSC or enough information to calculate the IR. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved by consensus with third-party experts (R.P.M. and G.G.K.).Data ExtractionTwo reviewers independently extracted data for each study. The variable of interest was the incidence of PSC. The IR per 100,000 person-years with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was documented for the overall study period and for individual years when they were reported. Secondary variables extracted from the articles included the following: the method of case ascertainment (i.e., a patient registry or administrative database), the country of origin, the study time period, the median age and range, the male/female incidence rate ratio (IRR), the incidence of small-duct and large-duct PSC, the percentage of PSC cases with IBD, and information on key indicators of study quality from MOOSE.21Statistical AnalysisThe incidence of PSC was summarized with an IR, which was defined as the number of cases in a population per 100,000 personyears at risk in the population. IRs adjusted for confounding factors were selected over unadjusted IRs. The standard errors (SEs) and 95% CIs for the IRs were estimated under the assumption of a Poisson distribution. The ratio of males to females was summarized with an IRR, which was defined as the IR of PSC in males over the IR of PSC in females. When the IRR was not reported but the number of male and female incident PSC cases and the total study population were included, the IRR was calculated under the assumption that the background population was 50% male.Heterogeneity was assessed with the Q statistic (5% level), and meta-analyses were performed with random-effects models because of the presence of heterogeneity between studies. Stratified analyses and meta-regression were performed according to the methods of case ascertainment (i.e., administrative data versus patient registry data) and the region of publication (i.e., North America versus Europe).The study time periods were not stratified because there was considerableoverlap between them. Te mporal trends were calculated with Joinpoint regression analysis,22 by which, through a series of permutations, tests were performed to assess whether the addition of joinpoints resulted in statistically significant linear changes in the direction or magnitude of the rates in comparison with a linear line. Two joinpoints at most were considered. The parameter estimate used to summarize the trend over the fixed interval was the average annual percentage change (AAPC) according to a generalized log-linear model that assumed a Poisson distribution.Sensitivity analyses were conducted by the exclusion of studies that were not population-based because this was considered the most important difference in the quality of the studies.The possibility of publication bias was assessed with the Begg test.",False,1.0,1.0,True

For the conduct of this systematic review, we followed the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses 
(PRISMA) statement (Shamseer et al., 2015). With the assistance of a 
library scientist, we searched for randomized trials indexed from 1980 
to May 11, 2017 in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, MEDLINE 
inprocess, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, 
CINAHL, and PsychINFO. The search strategy included Medical Subject 
Heading terms and text words that identified patients with cancer or 
HSCT recipients who received an intervention to reduce fatigue. Appendix
 A shows the full search strategies.2.1. Study selectionEligibility
 criteria were defined a priori. We included studies if participants of 
any age had cancer or were HSCT recipients, and if the study was a fully
 published primary randomized or quasi-randomized trial with a parallel 
group design. The study had to evaluate an intervention for the 
prevention or treatment of fatigue. We excluded studies if less than 75%
 of participants had cancer or were undergoing HSCT; if fatigue was 
either not an end-point or reported as an adverse effect; if the 
intervention was direct cancer treatment; and if less than five 
participants were randomized to any study arm. We did not restrict 
inclusion by language. For the purpose of this systematic review, we 
then limited studies to those in which non-physical activity mind and 
body practices were the intervention being evaluated.Two 
reviewers (SO, PDR or LS) independently evaluated the titles and 
abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy. Any publication 
considered potentially relevant by any reviewer was retrieved in full 
and assessed for eligibility by two reviewers (SO, PDR or LS). Inclusion
 of studies in this systematic review was determined by agreement of 
both reviewers. Discrepancies between the two reviewers were resolved by
 consensus and adjudication by a third reviewer if required (LLD or LS).
 Agreement in study inclusion between the two reviewers was described 
using the kappa statistic. Strength of agreement was defined as slight 
(0.00â€“0.20), fair (0.21â€“0.40), moderate (0.41â€“0.60), substantial 
(0.61â€“0.80), or almost perfect (0.81â€“1.00) (Koch et al., 1977).2.2. Data abstraction and outcomesData
 were abstracted in duplicate by two reviewers (ND, HD or PDR) and any 
discrepancies were resolved by consensus. If discrepancies could not be 
resolved by consensus, a third reviewer (LS) adjudicated. We contacted 
authors in the event of missing primary outcome data.The 
primary outcome was self-reported fatigue severity across the fatigue 
scales used in the primary studies. For studies that used more than one 
fatigue scale, we selected one scale to be used for analyses based upon

Study Selection
We conducted a comprehensive search of
Pubmed (1946 to April 2017) and PsycInfo (1597 to April 2017) using terms (see
S-Table 1) related to prenatal, obesity, offspring and neurodevelopment. The
term â€˜neurodevelopmentalâ€™ included ASD, ADHD, cognitive and intellectual delay
and emotional/behavioral problems. We included observational studies
irrespective of publication status, language, sample size, follow-up duration
or BMI classification standard.
Three coders (CES, KR, AM) examined each
articleâ€™s title, abstract, and keywords from the search results. Each coder
worked independently to determine whether an article met inclusion criteria. If
disagreements between coders could not be resolved, the senior author (BFF) was
consulted. If relevant articles were misclassified during the initial coding
process, two other techniques (see below for more detail) were used to help
uncover the reports again. In total, 1483 abstracts were examined âˆ’ 57 (4%)
were deemed to meet inclusion criteria.
Two other types of searches were conducted
on any empirical study report and/or literature review that was determined to
be relevant. We examined reference lists of all reports that met inclusion
criteria to determine whether they cited any potentially relevant article
(backward search). We then conducted a cited reference search to determine
whether the reports that met inclusion criteria had been later cited by any potentially
relevant article (forward search). For backward and forward searches, titles
and abstracts were initially reviewed by the first author (CES), and if deemed
potentially relevant, the full-text was obtained. These search strategies
yielded an additional 6 reports.
To minimize publication bias, we contacted
authors whose articles reported maternal obesity and neurodevelopmental
outcomes but did not provide adjusted or unadjusted ORs, and requested raw data
so that we could calculate unadjusted ORs. For 12 articles (with publication
dates within the past 10 years), we received 4 responses that allowed us to
include the report in the meta-analysis and 2 responses that provided
information to include in the synthesis.
Data Extraction
Numerous characteristics of each study were
retrieved using a standardized data collection form. These characteristics
encompassed six broad domains: (a) the research report included basic
information about authorship and date of publication; (b) study characteristics
included information about the cohort, source of study population, and study
design; (c) quality indicators to assess observational studies
(see below); (d) sample information included demographic characteristics of the
cohorts; (e) outcome measures included information pertaining to the
neurodevelopmental outcomes and covariates; and (f) estimate of effect size
detailed the information needed to derive an unadjusted OR or adjusted OR and
95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Data extraction was completed by 4 reviewers
(CB, KR, AS, AM), with each article being independently coded twice. If there
was a discrepancy in coding, the two coders discussed each disagreement until
agreement was reached. If the disagreement could not be resolved, the first
author was consulted. This method results in high effective reliability.22
Quality assessmentâ€”A Quality Assessment
Scale was developed based on Tooth et al.23 and similar to Yu et al.24 (see
S-Table 2). We assessed the quality of all included studies based on 8
indicators: type of study, loss to follow-up, sample size, participant
selection, comparability of groups, statistical methods, criteria for
determining and categorizing pre-pregnancy weight, and measurement of
neurodevelopmental outcome. The quality of each study was classified as high
(>14), medium (11â€“14), or low ( 30 for
obese, reported in kg/m2 metric), although there were some exceptions. Three
articles grouped overweight and obese mothers together28â€“30; thus, these were
analyzed only as a combined obese and overweight category. Other articles
defined pre-pregnancy obesity as >30 BMI and all other participants were
defined as non-obese at","### B:

Data Sources and Search Strategy
An extensive, unrestricted, computerized
MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library literature search of articles in English
and French was independently conducted by 2 reviewers (J.A., L.D.) according to
prespeciï¬ed selection criteria from inception to April 3, 2018. We also
considered studies selected from prior meta-analyses related to the impact of
MRAs on AF occurrence6,7; trial protocols on trial registry platforms,
including clinicaltrials.gov ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/), the World Health
Organizationâ€™s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform
( http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/), the UK Clinical Trials Gateway ( https://www.ukctg.nihr.ac.uk/),
and EudraCT ( https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/); and data from scientiï¬c meeting
abstracts and conferences. We used both controlled terms (ie, MeSH terms in
MEDLINE) and free-text terms related to MRAs as domain 1 (details of the search
are provided in Figure 1). Regarding domain 2 (AF domain), as we did not expect
that AF would be reported often in study titles or abstracts (because AF is
often a secondary end point of MRA studies), we did not create a speciï¬c search
domain using the free term â€œAFâ€ to avoid restricting search strategy.
Therefore, we computed a larger domain using the terms â€œcardiovascular diseaseâ€
OR â€œheart diseaseâ€ OR â€œatrial ï¬brillationâ€ (domain 2). The ï¬nal research was
performed as follows: (domain 1) AND (domain 2). Second, a manual search was
performed for relevant references from the selected articles.
Study Selection
Studies evaluating the effects of MRAs
(study intervention) compared with non-MRA drugs (placebo or other control
drugs, study comparator) on AF occurrence in adult patients were included.
Studies using comparators other than drugs were not included. Clinical trials
(randomized or nonrandomized, parallel arm, and cluster designs) and clinical
observational comparative studies (including retrospective or prospective
cohorts and case-control or nested case-control designs) reporting any AF
outcomes and the use of MRAs were included. We excluded cross-sectional
studies, case series, crossover studies, and case reports. Healthcare/health
insurance database studies were also excluded because this type of database
does not offer much valuable clinical information to allow the conduct of
subgroup and meta-regression analyses.
Data Extraction
Two review authors (J.A., L.D.)
independently screened study titles and abstracts identiï¬ed by the search
against eligibility criteria. Full reports were obtained for all eligible
articles/abstracts. The review authors independently extracted data from the
selected studies in duplicate using a standardized data extraction form. Any

Search strategy
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to December 2015
using a sensitive search strategy combining the following Medical Subject
Headings (MESHs) and keywords: haemorrhage, bleed, invasive procedure,
surgery, general surgery, surg*, emergencies, procedure, warfarin,
acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, vit-amin K antagonist, blood component
transfusion, plasma, fresh frozen plasma, blood coagulation factors,
coagulants, prothrombin complex concentrate, prothrombin, factor X, factor
IX, factor VII, factor II, beriplex, kcentra, confidex, octaplex and
profilnine. A manual review of reference lists was also conducted.
Potential sources of unpublished data were searched through
www.clinical trials.gov up to December 2015.
The methods and outcomes were reported according to PRISMA
recommendations (18). The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO
Trial Registration (#CRD42015017383).
Study selection
Two reviewers (CC and CH) independently performed study
selection using pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Randomised
controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies (prospective or
retrospective) were eligible, with no language restriction. We included
studies that investigated adult patients (aged 18 years or older) who
presented with warfarin associated major bleeding, or those who required
urgent warfarin reversal for surgery or an invasive procedure. We selected
only studies comparing PCC (either 3F- or 4F-PCC) to FFP. Studies that
evaluated a combination of PCCs and FFP or factor VIIa as a co-intervention
were excluded. If the same patients were used in multiple studies, we chose
the study with the largest sample size or most complete out-come report.
Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by consensus or a third
reviewer (MC).
Data extraction
Data were extracted independently by two reviewers (CC and
CH) using a standardised data record form. The following information was
extracted and recorded: first author, year of publication, inclusion
criteria, study design, mean or median age of participants, sex,
indications for anticoagulant therapy, bleeding site, type of surgery
(procedure), type and dose of PCC, dose of FFP and du-ration of follow-up.
Discrepancies between the reviewers resolved by consensus or a third
reviewer (MC).
Outcomes
The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days. We
chose the 30-day period because this reflects the efficacy and safety of
re-versal agents during bleeding and surgical events. Delayed deaths beyond
this point are more likely to be associated with causes un-related to
warfarin reversal treatment choice. The secondary out-comes were volume
overload, thromboembolic events, haemostasis, speed of INR reduction,
proportion of patients who achieved INR correction and red blood cell (RBC)
transfusion.
Risk of bias assessment
The methodological quality of the randomized studies was
evaluated independently by two reviewers (CC and RM) using the Cochrane
Collaborationâ€™s Risk of Bias tool (19), scoring each study for: random
sequence generation, allocation concealment, method of blinding,
completeness of data, selective outcome reporting and other risks of bias.
Each parameter was judged as a high, low or unclear risk of bias.
Disagreements were resolved by consensus or through a third reviewer (MC).
The quality of the observational studies was assessed using
A Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool: for Non-Randomized Studies of
Interventions (ACROBAT-NRSI) (20). We evaluated the risk of bias based on
confounding, selection of participants, measurement of the interventions,
departures from intended intervention, missing data, measurement of outcomes
and selection of the reported results. Each outcome was judged as a low,
moderate, serious, critical and no information. We generated funnel plots
of effect size versus standard error of effect estimates in order to assess
for potential publication bias. Publication bias was considered to be
present if the funnel plots were asymmetrical.
Data synthesis
To compare differences between categorical outcomes between
PCC and FFP, we generated pooled odd ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95 %
confidence intervals (CIs) using a Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model (21).
Pooled results of continuous outcomes were summarised using mean difference
(MD) and corresponding 95 % CI. Heterogeneity was classified based on a
scale of I2: contributory (I2 = 0â€“30 %), moderate (I2= 30â€“50 %), substantial
(I2= 50â€“75 %) and considerable (I2 > 75 %) (21). A p-value less than 0.05
was considered statistically significant for all tests. Absolute risk
reduction (ARR) and number needed to treat were calculated.
We performed a priori subgroup analysis according to
indication for warfarin reversal (major bleeding or urgent surgery or
invasive procedure) and type of PCC (3F- and 4F-PCC). Sensitivity analyses
were carried out for study design (randomised controlled studies or
observational studies). We reanalysed the data when removing study with
high risk of bias. In addition, all analyses were repeated with fixed-effect
modelling.
The main analysis was performed using Review Manager
(RevMan) version 5.3 (Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane
Collaboration, 2014).
Trial sequential analysis
To address possible Type I (random) error and ensure
adequate meta-analysis information size (22, 23), we constructed a trial
sequential analysis for the three clinically relevant outcomes (all-cause
mortality, congestive heart failure/volume overload and thromboembolic
events). We calculated the required information size (meta-analysis sample
size) for the primary out-come based on an assumption of a plausible
reduction in the relative risk of all-cause mortality from the pooled
estimates (30 %) when the patients received PCC as compared with FFP given a
baseline mortality rate of 13 % (1), type I error of 5 % and type II error
of 20 %. For this analysis, the trial sequential monitoring boundaries for
benefit and harm were constructed. We used TSA software version 0.9 beta
(available on http://ww.ctu.dk/tsa/ ).
Assessment of the quality of the evidences across studies
We assessed the quality of the body of evidence from the
included studies using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool (24). The quality of the evidence
for all outcomes was judged as very low, low, moderate or high based on the
following domains; risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision
and publication bias (25). The summary of findings table was constructed
using GRADEpro (McMaster University 2014, available on www. gradepro.org).",False,1.0,1.0,True

 random-effects model was used. The meta-analysis was conducted for 
outcomes reported in a minimum of 3 studies, due to the potential for 
greater uncertainty with fewer studies [23]. The effect size (ES) of 
controlled studies was calculated, when possible, to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the IDE intervention. The reported ES was based on the 
relative size of Cohenâ€™s d, which categorizes the studies in the 
following four levels: d < 0.2 = negligible effect, over 0.2 = a 
small effect, over 0.5 = a medium effect, and over 0.8 = a large effect 
[24]. The corresponding 95th confidence intervals (CIs) were also 
reported for each outcome.","### B:

otherwise, results of adjusted analyses were used. Random effects models
 were used to calculate summary estimates and to adjust for potential 
heterogeneity. Studies were weighted according to the inverse of the 
variance of the log HR. Overall effects were assessed by using the 
Ztest, and heterogeneity was tested by using Cochranâ€™s v2 test. The I2 
statistic was used to assess heterogeneity, which was defined as low, 
moderate, or high with I2 values >25%, >50%, and >75%, 
respectively (11). If a research group contributed multiple studies with

Search strategy
A comprehensive literature search of PubMed was
conducted between 28 May and 4 June 2018. Three search strings were formulated
related to BMI and obesity (â€œbody mass indexâ€, â€œBMIâ€, â€œobesityâ€, â€œobeseâ€, â€œbody
weightâ€, â€œweight lossâ€, â€œweight gainâ€), ALS (â€œALSâ€, â€œAmyotrophic lateral sclerosisâ€)
and â€œmotor neuron diseaseâ€ (see Supplementary Table S2). No publication date restriction
was imposed. Reference lists of retrieved studies were also searched manually
to identify additional studies.
Eligibility criteria
Articles were included in the meta-analysis if
they satisfied the following criteria: (1) quantitatively comparative design
involving consecutive patients; (2) patients were diagnosed with definite,
probable, probable (laboratory-supported), or possible ALS according to the El
Escorial revised criteria (20), without restrictions on gender, age or other major
patient characteristics; (3) impact of BMI or obesity was analyzed
independently of other comorbidities; (4) the primary outcome was overall survival
(OS), and adequate data were reported to estimate odds ratios (ORs), relative
risks (RRs) and hazard ratios (HRs); and (5) studies were published as
full-text articles in peer-reviewed English-language journals.
Case studies, reviews, preclinical experiments,
conference abstracts and letters were excluded. If studies involved overlapping
study populations, only the most recent study was included.
Data collection
The following data were extracted from included
studies into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet: authors, publication year, country
of origin, study design, study period, sample size, gender composition, age,
BMI cutoff for the definition of obesity, score on the ALS functional rating
scale-revised (ALSFRS-R), length of follow-up, outcome measures and data,
statistical methods, and results of tests. Studies were categorized according
to whether they treated BMI as a continuous variable or dichotomous variable
(obese vs. normal). For the purpose of this meta-analysis and in accordance

For the conduct of this systematic review, we followed the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses 
(PRISMA) statement (Shamseer et al., 2015). With the assistance of a 
library scientist, we searched for randomized trials indexed from 1980 
to May 11, 2017 in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, MEDLINE 
inprocess, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, 
CINAHL, and PsychINFO. The search strategy included Medical Subject 
Heading terms and text words that identified patients with cancer or 
HSCT recipients who received an intervention to reduce fatigue. Appendix
 A shows the full search strategies.2.1. Study selectionEligibility
 criteria were defined a priori. We included studies if participants of 
any age had cancer or were HSCT recipients, and if the study was a fully
 published primary randomized or quasi-randomized trial with a parallel 
group design. The study had to evaluate an intervention for the 
prevention or treatment of fatigue. We excluded studies if less than 75%
 of participants had cancer or were undergoing HSCT; if fatigue was 
either not an end-point or reported as an adverse effect; if the 
intervention was direct cancer treatment; and if less than five 
participants were randomized to any study arm. We did not restrict 
inclusion by language. For the purpose of this systematic review, we 
then limited studies to those in which non-physical activity mind and 
body practices were the intervention being evaluated.Two 
reviewers (SO, PDR or LS) independently evaluated the titles and 
abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy. Any publication 
considered potentially relevant by any reviewer was retrieved in full 
and assessed for eligibility by two reviewers (SO, PDR or LS). Inclusion
 of studies in this systematic review was determined by agreement of 
both reviewers. Discrepancies between the two reviewers were resolved by
 consensus and adjudication by a third reviewer if required (LLD or LS).
 Agreement in study inclusion between the two reviewers was described 
using the kappa statistic. Strength of agreement was defined as slight 
(0.00â€“0.20), fair (0.21â€“0.40), moderate (0.41â€“0.60), substantial 
(0.61â€“0.80), or almost perfect (0.81â€“1.00) (Koch et al., 1977).2.2. Data abstraction and outcomesData
 were abstracted in duplicate by two reviewers (ND, HD or PDR) and any 
discrepancies were resolved by consensus. If discrepancies could not be 
resolved by consensus, a third reviewer (LS) adjudicated. We contacted 
authors in the event of missing primary outcome data.The 
primary outcome was self-reported fatigue severity across the fatigue 
scales used in the primary studies. For studies that used more than one 
fatigue scale, we selected one scale to be used for analyses based upon 
an a priori developed rule. We selected the most prevalent fatigue scale
 used across studies (see Appendix B).2.3. Categorization of non-physical activity mind and body practice interventions and control groupsThe
 interventions were non-physical activity mind and body practices. 
Practices were classified as: (1) acupuncture and acupressure; (2) 
mindfulness (practice of enhancing awareness of thoughts, emotions, and 
experiences) (Anonymous, 2017a); (3) relaxation techniques (such as 
progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery); (4) massage 
therapies; (5) energy therapies (including Reiki, therapeutic touch, and
 healing touch) (Anonymous, 2017b); (6) energizing yogic breathing; and

2.1 Search Strategy and Study SelectionThe systematic review and meta-analysis on the role of miRNAs in melanoma were carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines [15]. The study search was carried out in bibliographic databases including EMBASE, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus and Web of science to identify relevant studies published between January 2011 and April 2018. A few studies were also obtained from the reference lists of these selected articles. Two authors (SS and MRM) performed the article search independently, and the corresponding author (RJ) performed a final review of the entire search and extracted articles.2.2 Selection CriteriaStudies included in our systematic review and meta-analysis were selected using the following inclusion and exclusion criteria.Inclusion criteria:1. Studies that discussed the role of miRNAs and the survival outcome of melanoma patients.2. Studies that reported HR and 95% CI values.3. Articles published between 2012 and 2018.4. Studies that interpreted survival analysis (clinical end-point) with univariate or multivariate analysis.5. Studies that were in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analysis.6. Studies with Kaplanâ€“Meier (KM) curves were also selected if it was possible to retrieve HR and 95% CI values from the KM curves.Exclusion criteria:1. Conference abstracts, reviews and letters to the editor were not within the scope of our analysis.2. Studies reporting in vitro, in silico and other non-human (animal) miRNA expression.3. Unpublished articles/theses and incomplete studies.4. Studies that discussed tumour histology, tumour differentiation and other malignant potential specifically if they failed to discuss the survival outcomes of miRNA in melanoma.5. Articles that reported prognosis results for a sample size less than ten.2.3 Type of ParticipantsThis current study involves clinical data from the patient cohorts in the included studies that were identified through the online search. There were no limitations of gender, age, tumour stage, lymph nodes or any treatment parameters. Similarly, data on tissue, serum, skin lesions and plasma samples from the included studies were included in this study to investigate the expression of miRNAs in melanoma patients. The follow-up period was extracted from the included studies.2.4 Data Extraction and ManagementData were extracted from the included studies independently; any discrepancies were discussed amongst all authors, and the final decision was taken through a team decision. Using Microsoft ExcelÂ® (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA), data items were extracted after a manual check by the review team for evaluation of study quality and data synthesis. Data items such as author names, publication year, gender, study period, diagnostic methods, follow-up period, sunlight exposure, ulceration, TNM (tumour node metastasis) stages, endpoint determination, survival status and miRNA expressions were retrieved for further analysis. Endnote (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA) was used as a bibliographic reference manager to avoid duplication of the included studies.2.5 Quality Assessment and Risk of Bias of Individual StudiesTwo reviewers performed quality assessment of the included studies independently using the quality assessment tool from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI): Quality Assessment of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Quality Assessment Tool for observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies [16]. Before attempting to extract the data items from the individual studies, a quality assessment was performed. This assessment tool was applied to all the selected full-text articles, and they were then categorised into good, fair or poor. Fourteen elements of quality assessment, including patient population and selection, study comparability, follow-up and outcome of interest, are addressed by this tool [16]. The risk of bias is inversely correlated with the quality of the study. While a high risk of bias translates to a rating of poor quality, a low risk of bias translates to a rating of good quality. The name and version of the assessment tool used, the risk of bias graph/summary, incomplete outcome data and other potential sources of bias were also assessed. Data were summarised using descriptive statistics (frequency, percentage).2.6 Assessment of Heterogeneity and StatisticsComprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software (version 3.3.070; Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA) was used to perform the meta-analysis to generate forest plots using HRs and associated 95% CIs of survival endpoints (overall survival [OS], disease-free survival [DFS], recurrence-free survival [RFS], metastasis-free survival [MFS], progression-free survival [PFS] and post-recurrence survival [PRS]) from the selected studies. The pooled effect size estimate of the HR was estimated using random-effects model meta-analysis. The effect size of the HR on melanoma patients indicates the important aspects of the prognostic impact of miRNAs. The mean effect size of the HR is a crucial tool in reporting and interpreting the effectiveness of miRNAs on melanoma patientsâ€™ prognosis, generally referring to the comparative and collective effect size estimates of the different studies. The mean effect estimate of the HR is more frequently used in meta-analysis than its statistical significance or the sample size of the individual studies [17, 18]. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Higgins I2 statistic and Cochranâ€™s Q-test [19]. Cochranâ€™s Q-test was used secondary to the I2 statistic given its low power of heterogeneity detection. In case of any discrepancy, the I2 statistic was given precedence [20]. The forest plots were analysed to elucidate the outcomes of patient survival in melanoma. Subgroup analysis was carried out for the repeated miRNAs with the same methods for cumulative meta-analysis.2.7 Publication BiasPublication bias was estimated to assess any bias in the included studies. Funnel plots, Orwin and classic fail-safe N tests [21], Begg and Mazumdar Rank correlation tests [22], the Harbord-Eggerâ€™s test of the intercept [23] and Duval and Tweedieâ€™s trim and fill method [24] calculations were used.2.7.1 Funnel PlotsFunnel plots for each study effect size about their sample size were constructed with scattered plots, where a lack of skew or asymmetry indicated an absence of publication bias.2.7.2 Classic Failâ€‘Safe and Orwin Failâ€‘Safe N TestsBoth the Orwin fail-safe N test and classic fail-safe N test were applied to determine studies that are missing from the systematic review and meta-analysis, even with the advent of complete online bibliographic searching. These tests help to enumerate the studies in a meta-analysis which transfers the effect size towards null and also makes it possible to interpret whether it is true or false [21].2.7.3 Begg and Mazumdar Rank Correlation TestThe Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation test uses the correlation between the ranks of effect sizes and the ranks of their variances. Inverse correlation may occur between study size and effect size due to the sizeable prognostic effects in melanoma patients. Therefore, we estimated the rank order correlation (Kendallâ€™s tau-b) between the prognostic effect and the standard error (which is driven primarily by sample size). Positive values indicate a trend towards a higher level of test accuracy in studies with smaller sample sizes [22].2.7.4 Eggerâ€™s Test of the InterceptThe Egger regression gives the degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from a regression of standard normal which deviates against precision [23]. This test was performed to determine whether there is an association between test accuracy estimates (estimate divided by its standard error) and their precision (reciprocal of the standard error of the estimate).2.7.5 Duval and Tweedieâ€™s Trim and Fill MethodA rank-based method was used to estimate the number of missing studies from the meta-analysis due to suppression of the most extreme results on one side of the funnel plot and to produce an adjusted estimate of test accuracy by inputting suspected missing studies. It initially trims the asymmetric studies from the right-hand side to locate the unbiased effect (in an iterative procedure), and then fills the plot by re-inserting the trimmed studies on the right and their input-ted counterparts to the left of the mean effect [24].",False,1.0,1.0,True

sÂ²) was estimated by the REML method (20). CIs for sÂ² were obtained by the
Q-proï¬le method (21). The model parameters were estimated by way of weighted
least squares, with weights equal to the inverse sum of the variance of the
estimate and the estimate of the residual heterogeneity. Then, Wald-type tests
and CIs were obtained for the parameter estimates (20). We analyzed

Study Selection
We conducted a comprehensive search of
Pubmed (1946 to April 2017) and PsycInfo (1597 to April 2017) using terms (see
S-Table 1) related to prenatal, obesity, offspring and neurodevelopment. The
term â€˜neurodevelopmentalâ€™ included ASD, ADHD, cognitive and intellectual delay
and emotional/behavioral problems. We included observational studies
irrespective of publication status, language, sample size, follow-up duration
or BMI classification standard.
Three coders (CES, KR, AM) examined each
articleâ€™s title, abstract, and keywords from the search results. Each coder
worked independently to determine whether an article met inclusion criteria. If
disagreements between coders could not be resolved, the senior author (BFF) was
consulted. If relevant articles were misclassified during the initial coding
process, two other techniques (see below for more detail) were used to help
uncover the reports again. In total, 1483 abstracts were examined âˆ’ 57 (4%)
were deemed to meet inclusion criteria.
Two other types of searches were conducted
on any empirical study report and/or literature review that was determined to
be relevant. We examined reference lists of all reports that met inclusion
criteria to determine whether they cited any potentially relevant article
(backward search). We then conducted a cited reference search to determine
whether the reports that met inclusion criteria had been later cited by any potentially
relevant article (forward search). For backward and forward searches, titles
and abstracts were initially reviewed by the first author (CES), and if deemed
potentially relevant, the full-text was obtained. These search strategies
yielded an additional 6 reports.
To minimize publication bias, we contacted
authors whose articles reported maternal obesity and neurodevelopmental
outcomes but did not provide adjusted or unadjusted ORs, and requested raw data
so that we could calculate unadjusted ORs. For 12 articles (with publication
dates within the past 10 years), we received 4 responses that allowed us to
include the report in the meta-analysis and 2 responses that provided
information to include in the synthesis.
Data Extraction
Numerous characteristics of each study were
retrieved using a standardized data collection form. These characteristics
encompassed six broad domains: (a) the research report included basic
information about authorship and date of publication; (b) study characteristics
included information about the cohort, source of study population, and study
design; (c) quality indicators to assess observational studies
(see below); (d) sample information included demographic characteristics of the
cohorts; (e) outcome measures included information pertaining to the
neurodevelopmental outcomes and covariates; and (f) estimate of effect size
detailed the information needed to derive an unadjusted OR or adjusted OR and
95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Data extraction was completed by 4 reviewers
(CB, KR, AS, AM), with each article being independently coded twice. If there
was a discrepancy in coding, the two coders discussed each disagreement until
agreement was reached. If the disagreement could not be resolved, the first
author was consulted. This method results in high effective reliability.22
Quality assessmentâ€”A Quality Assessment
Scale was developed based on Tooth et al.23 and similar to Yu et al.24 (see
S-Table 2). We assessed the quality of all included studies based on 8
indicators: type of study, loss to follow-up, sample size, participant
selection, comparability of groups, statistical methods, criteria for
determining and categorizing pre-pregnancy weight, and measurement of
neurodevelopmental outcome. The quality of each study was classified as high
(>14), medium (11â€“14), or low ( 30 for
obese, reported in kg/m2 metric), although there were some exceptions. Three
articles grouped overweight and obese mothers together28â€“30; thus, these were
analyzed only as a combined obese and overweight category. Other articles
defined pre-pregnancy obesity as >30 BMI and all other participants were
defined as non-obese at","### C:

previously published studies.
Data Sources and Search Strategy
An extensive, unrestricted, computerized
MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library literature search of articles in English
and French was independently conducted by 2 reviewers (J.A., L.D.) according to
prespeciï¬ed selection criteria from inception to April 3, 2018. We also
considered studies selected from prior meta-analyses related to the impact of
MRAs on AF occurrence6,7; trial protocols on trial registry platforms,
including clinicaltrials.gov ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/), the World Health
Organizationâ€™s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform
( http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/), the UK Clinical Trials Gateway ( https://www.ukctg.nihr.ac.uk/),
and EudraCT ( https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/); and data from scientiï¬c meeting
abstracts and conferences. We used both controlled terms (ie, MeSH terms in
MEDLINE) and free-text terms related to MRAs as domain 1 (details of the search
are provided in Figure 1). Regarding domain 2 (AF domain), as we did not expect
that AF would be reported often in study titles or abstracts (because AF is
often a secondary end point of MRA studies), we did not create a speciï¬c search
domain using the free term â€œAFâ€ to avoid restricting search strategy.
Therefore, we computed a larger domain using the terms â€œcardiovascular diseaseâ€
OR â€œheart diseaseâ€ OR â€œatrial ï¬brillationâ€ (domain 2). The ï¬nal research was
performed as follows: (domain 1) AND (domain 2). Second, a manual search was
performed for relevant references from the selected articles.
Study Selection
Studies evaluating the effects of MRAs
(study intervention) compared with non-MRA drugs (placebo or other control
drugs, study comparator) on AF occurrence in adult patients were included.
Studies using comparators other than drugs were not included. Clinical trials
(randomized or nonrandomized, parallel arm, and cluster designs) and clinical
observational comparative studies (including retrospective or prospective
cohorts and case-control or nested case-control designs) reporting any AF
outcomes and the use of MRAs were included. We excluded cross-sectional
studies, case series, crossover studies, and case reports. Healthcare/health
insurance database studies were also excluded because this type of database
does not offer much valuable clinical information to allow the conduct of
subgroup and meta-regression analyses.
Data Extraction
Two review authors (J.A., L.D.)
independently screened study titles and abstracts identiï¬ed by the search
against eligibility criteria. Full reports were obtained for all eligible
articles/abstracts. The review authors independently extracted data from the

Search strategyWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to December 2015 using a sensitive search strategy combining the following Medical Subject Headings (MESHs) and keywords: haemorrhage, bleed, invasive procedure, surgery, general surgery, surg*, emergencies, procedure, warfarin, acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, vit-amin K antagonist, blood component transfusion, plasma, fresh frozen plasma, blood coagulation factors, coagulants, prothrombin complex concentrate, prothrombin, factor X, factor IX, factor VII, factor II, beriplex, kcentra, confidex, octaplex and profilnine. A manual review of reference lists was also conducted. Potential sources of unpublished data were searched through www.clinical trials.gov up to December 2015.The methods and outcomes were reported according to PRISMA recommendations (18). The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO Trial Registration (#CRD42015017383).Study selectionTwo reviewers (CC and CH) independently performed study selection using pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies (prospective or retrospective) were eligible, with no language restriction. We included studies that investigated adult patients (aged 18 years or older) who presented with warfarin associated major bleeding, or those who required urgent warfarin reversal for surgery or an invasive procedure. We selected only studies comparing PCC (either 3F- or 4F-PCC) to FFP. Studies that evaluated a combination of PCCs and FFP or factor VIIa as a co-intervention were excluded. If the same patients were used in multiple studies, we chose the study with the largest sample size or most complete out-come report. Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by consensus or a third reviewer (MC).Data extractionData were extracted independently by two reviewers (CC and CH) using a standardised data record form. The following information was extracted and recorded: first author, year of publication, inclusion criteria, study design, mean or median age of participants, sex, indications for anticoagulant therapy, bleeding site, type of surgery (procedure), type and dose of PCC, dose of FFP and du-ration of follow-up. Discrepancies between the reviewers resolved by consensus or a third reviewer (MC).OutcomesThe primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days. We chose the 30-day period because this reflects the efficacy and safety of re-versal agents during bleeding and surgical events. Delayed deaths beyond this point are more likely to be associated with causes un-related to warfarin reversal treatment choice. The secondary out-comes were volume overload, thromboembolic events, haemostasis, speed of INR reduction, proportion of patients who achieved INR correction and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion.Risk of bias assessmentThe methodological quality of the randomized studies was evaluated independently by two reviewers (CC and RM) using the Cochrane Collaborationâ€™s Risk of Bias tool (19), scoring each study for: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, method of blinding, completeness of data, selective outcome reporting and other risks of bias. Each parameter was judged as a high, low or unclear risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or through a third reviewer (MC).The quality of the observational studies was assessed using A Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool: for Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ACROBAT-NRSI) (20). We evaluated the risk of bias based on confounding, selection of participants, measurement of the interventions, departures from intended intervention, missing data, measurement of outcomes and selection of the reported results. Each outcome was judged as a low, moderate, serious, critical and no information.We generated funnel plots of effect size versus standard error of effect estimates in order to assess for potential publication bias. Publication bias was considered to be present if the funnel plots were asymmetrical.Data synthesisTo compare differences between categorical outcomes between PCC and FFP, we generated pooled odd ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) using a Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model (21). Pooled results of continuous outcomes were summarised using mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95 % CI. Heterogeneity was classified based on a scale of I2: contributory (I2 = 0â€“30 %), moderate (I2= 30â€“50 %), substantial (I2= 50â€“75 %) and considerable (I2 > 75 %) (21). A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all tests. Absolute risk reduction (ARR) and number needed to treat were calculated. We performed a priori subgroup analysis according to indication for warfarin reversal (major bleeding or urgent surgery or invasive procedure) and type of PCC (3F- and 4F-PCC). Sensitivity analyses were carried out for study design (randomised controlled studies or observational studies). We reanalysed the data when removing study with high risk of bias. In addition, all analyses were repeated with fixed-effect modelling. The main analysis was performed using Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.3 (Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014).Trial sequential analysisTo address possible Type I (random) error and ensure adequate meta-analysis information size (22, 23), we constructed a trial sequential analysis for the three clinically relevant outcomes (all-cause mortality, congestive heart failure/volume overload and thromboembolic events). We calculated the required information size (meta-analysis sample size) for the primary out-come based on an assumption of a plausible reduction in the relative risk of all-cause mortality from the pooled estimates (30 %) when the patients received PCC as compared with FFP given a baseline mortality rate of 13 % (1), type I error of 5 % and type II error of 20 %. For this analysis, the trial sequential monitoring boundaries for benefit and harm were constructed. We used TSA software version 0.9 beta (available on http://ww.ctu.dk/tsa/).Assessment of the quality of the evidences across studiesWe assessed the quality of the body of evidence from the included studies using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool (24). The quality of the evidence for all outcomes was judged as very low, low, moderate or high based on the following domains; risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias (25).

Separate statistical meta-analyses 
were performed for RCTs and retrospective (observational) studies 
following practical guidelines for the inclusion of non-randomized 
trials.16 These meta-analyses used random-effects models fitted on 
log-transformation of calculated odds ratios (ORs) that account for both
 correlations among observations from the same studies (within-study 
variance) or variations from different studies (between-study variance).
 The random-effects models also weigh studies differently based on their
 sample sizes. It placed more weights on studies with more patients and 
less weights on studies with fewer patients. The results from 
random-effects models were transformed back to construct ORs and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for each reviewed study. The combined 
(weighed) ORs and their 95% CIs were calculated from the models to 
determine the significance of DCB. If the 95% CIs of combined ORs 
contained 1, then there was no significant DCB effect on TLPP. If 95% 
CIs were less than 1, then DCB had a significant effect on the outcome. 
If 95% CIs were greater than 1, then conventional balloons result in 
better outcome compared to DCB. Visualization of the results was 
summarized in forest plots with square sizes proportional to weights of 
studies at OR estimates and segments around the squares representing 95%
 CIs. The random-effects models also provided chi-square test of 
heterogeneity. The chi-square test of heterogeneity helped to determine 
whether studies were similar or not. Heterogeneity among studies is

 is the difference in mean between the start and end of the 
intervention. Pooled standard deviation was also calculated using the 
following formula:where SEM = SD/âˆšsample size. Heterogeneity was 
assessed across studies using the diamond ratio (DR); a DR > 2 
implies considerable heterogeneity [22]. In the case of heterogeneity, a
 random-effects model was used. The meta-analysis was conducted for 
outcomes reported in a minimum of 3 studies, due to the potential for 
greater uncertainty with fewer studies [23]. The effect size (ES) of 
controlled studies was calculated, when possible, to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the IDE intervention. The reported ES was based on the 
relative size of Cohenâ€™s d, which categorizes the studies in the 
following four levels: d < 0.2 = negligible effect, over 0.2 = a 
small effect, over 0.5 = a medium effect, and over 0.8 = a large effect 
[24]. The corresponding 95th confidence intervals (CIs) were also 
reported for each outcome.","### C:

relevant MeSH headings (Supplementary Material, File S1) and appropriate
restrictions (time limit: from January 2004 to March 2020, language: English)
was designed. A systematic literature search was performed in EMBASE (via
Ovid), MEDLINE (via PubMed) and Cochrane CENTRAL.
Eligible studies were randomized controlled
trials or observational studies comparing NITLs to thoracoscopic lobectomies
under GA. Letters, editorials, case reports, propensity score matching
analyses, expert opinions, meta-analyses and reviews were excluded. Records
identified through our search strategy were imported into reference management
software. In case of duplication, the most recent paper was selected. Two
authors worked independently to assess each identified study based on the
eligibility criteria. When multiple studies contained overlapping data, the
most informative study was included. Disagreements were discussed and resolved
by consensus with a third investigator. After preliminary title/abstract
screening, potentially eligible papers underwent an in-depth full-text review
to select studies to be included in the meta-analysis. Data extracted included
study characteristics, baseline patient characteristics and primary and
secondary outcomes. The Cochrane Collaborationâ€™s tool was used to determine the
risk of bias for the primary outcome for included studies [8]. The risk of bias
due to incomplete outcome data was evaluated at an outcome level. In contrast,
the risk of bias due to sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding,
selective reporting or funding was evaluated at the study level. The risk of
bias was determined by 2 independent reviewers, and disagreements were settled
by discussion and consensus. Details of the protocol for this systematic review

Search strategy
A comprehensive literature search of PubMed was
conducted between 28 May and 4 June 2018. Three search strings were formulated
related to BMI and obesity (â€œbody mass indexâ€, â€œBMIâ€, â€œobesityâ€, â€œobeseâ€, â€œbody
weightâ€, â€œweight lossâ€, â€œweight gainâ€), ALS (â€œALSâ€, â€œAmyotrophic lateral sclerosisâ€)
and â€œmotor neuron diseaseâ€ (see Supplementary Table S2). No publication date restriction
was imposed. Reference lists of retrieved studies were also searched manually
to identify additional studies.
Eligibility criteria
Articles were included in the meta-analysis if
they satisfied the following criteria: (1) quantitatively comparative design
involving consecutive patients; (2) patients were diagnosed with definite,
probable, probable (laboratory-supported), or possible ALS according to the El
Escorial revised criteria (20), without restrictions on gender, age or other major
patient characteristics; (3) impact of BMI or obesity was analyzed
independently of other comorbidities; (4) the primary outcome was overall survival
(OS), and adequate data were reported to estimate odds ratios (ORs), relative
risks (RRs) and hazard ratios (HRs); and (5) studies were published as
full-text articles in peer-reviewed English-language journals.
Case studies, reviews, preclinical experiments,
conference abstracts and letters were excluded. If studies involved overlapping
study populations, only the most recent study was included.
Data collection
The following data were extracted from included
studies into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet: authors, publication year, country
of origin, study design, study period, sample size, gender composition, age,
BMI cutoff for the definition of obesity, score on the ALS functional rating
scale-revised (ALSFRS-R), length of follow-up, outcome measures and data,
statistical methods, and results of tests. Studies were categorized according
to whether they treated BMI as a continuous variable or dichotomous variable
(obese vs. normal). For the purpose of this meta-analysis and in accordance

The meta-analysis was performed following PRISMA guidelines12.
Search and inclusion criteria
We conducted an electronic search without language restrictions using
MEDLINE/PubMed, the Cochrane library, ISI Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL and
the US National Institutes of Health clinical trials registry
( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). The following search terms were used:
antipsychotic(s); neuroleptic(s); individual names of SGAs; schizophrenia;
random, randomly, randomized; and maintenance, relapse, discontinuation or
long-term. The last search was done on October 29, 2018. The electronic search
was supplemented by a hand search of reference lists of relevant studies and
reviews. Authors and companies were contacted to provide missing information
and unpublished data.
We included randomized, head-to-head comparisons of oral SGAs in adults with
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder which reported on treatment
discontinuation, whether randomization occurred during the acute or maintenance
phase. As we aimed to focus on the comparative long-term effectiveness of SGAs,
we only included head-to-head studies lasting â‰¥6 months.
We excluded studies with >20% of non-schizophrenia/schizoaffective
disorder patients. As long-acting injectable formulation enhances the adherence
and therefore has a significant impact on long-term outcome13, 14, we excluded
studies on long-acting antipsychotics.
The search, selection of the literature, and data extraction were conducted
independently by â‰¥2 reviewers (KH, MN, TK, CC). Disagreements were resolved by
consensus.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was all-cause discontinuation at study endpoint.
Secondary outcomes included: a) psychopathology score change, measured by
the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Brief Psychiatric Rating
Scale (BPRS) or the Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) score (mixed
models or last-observation-carried-forward was prioritized over observed cases
analysis); b) inefficacy-related discontinuation (as reported by the original
study authors); c) intolerability-related discontinuation (as reported by the
original study authors); d) relapse (as reported by the original study
authors); e) hospitalization; f) remission (as reported by the original study
authors); g) functioning score; h) quality of life (QOL); and i) adverse
events.
Adverse events included: weight gain (as change from baseline or proportion
of patients with clinically significant increase); prolactin increase (as
change from baseline or proportion of patients with hyperprolactinemia);
neuromotor adverse effects, including parkinsonism assessed with the Simpson-Angus
Rating Scale or use of anticholinergics, akathisia and dyskinesia; and sedation
and/or somnolence.
Data analysis
SGAs were compared individually for each outcome. We applied a
â€œonce-randomized-analyzedâ€ intent-to-treat (ITT) endpoint analysis. In studies
that followed patients even after they were switched off the originally
allocated medication during the study period, we analyzed the primary outcome
based only on the first medication but, for secondary outcomes, we extracted
and analyzed the data as reported in the ITT sample.
Pooled risk ratio (RR) and standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models15. RR
values 1 indicate
superiority for the only positive outcome, remission. For simplicity we

Search StrategyWe conducted a systematic literature search with a predetermined protocol that was in accordance with the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) ,21 which studied the quality of reporting.21We searched MEDLINE (1950 to June 2010) and Embase (1980 to June 2010) for studies investigating the incidence of PSC. The search strategy is outlined in detail in Appendix I.The search was not limited by language or to human subjects.The reference lists of relevant articles were also reviewed.Selection CriteriaTwo reviewers (N.A.M. and H.K.) identified articles eligible for further review by performing an initial screening of identified abstracts and titles. Abstracts were eliminated if they were not observational and did not investigate the epidemiology of PSC. Studies that did not report original data (e.g., review articles) were also excluded. The full text of the remaining articles was retrieved and systematically reviewed according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles were included if they reported an incidence rate (IR) of PSC or enough information to calculate the IR.Disagreements between reviewers were resolved by consensus with third-party experts (R.P.M. and G.G.K.).Data ExtractionTwo reviewers independently extracted data for each study.The variable of interest was the incidence of PSC.The IR per 100,000 person-years with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was documented for the overall study period and for individual years when they were reported. Secondary variables extracted from the articles included the following: the method of case ascertainment (i.e., a patient registry or administrative database), the country of origin, the study time period, the median age and range, the male/female incidence rate ratio (IRR), the incidence of small-duct and large-duct PSC, the percentage of PSC cases with IBD, and information on key indicators of study quality from MOOSE.21Statistical AnalysisThe incidence of PSC was summarized with an IR, which was defined as the number of cases in a population per 100,000 personyears at risk in the population. IRs adjusted for confounding factors were selected over unadjusted IRs. The standard errors (SEs) and 95% CIs for the IRs were estimated under the assumption of a Poisson distribution. The ratio of males to females was summarized with an IRR, which was defined as the IR of PSC in males over the IR of PSC in females. When the IRR was not reported but the number of male and female incident PSC cases and the total study population were included, the IRR was calculated under the assumption that the background population was 50% male. Heterogeneity was assessed with the Q statistic (5% level), and meta-analyses were performed with random-effects models because of the presence of heterogeneity between studies. Stratified analyses and meta-regression were performed according to the methods of case ascertainment (i.e., administrative data versus patient registry data) and the region of publication (i.e., North America versus Europe). The study time periods were not stratified because there was considerableoverlap between them.Te mporal trends were calculated with Joinpoint regression analysis,22 by which, through a series of permutations, tests were performed to assess whether the addition of joinpoints resulted in statistically significant linear changes in the direction or magnitude of the rates in comparison with a linear line. Two joinpoints at most were considered. The parameter estimate used to summarize the trend over the fixed interval was the average annual percentage change (AAPC) according to a generalized log-linear model that assumed a Poisson distribution. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by the exclusion of studies that were not population-based because this was considered the most important difference in the quality of the studies.

For the conduct of this systematic review, we followed the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses 
(PRISMA) statement (Shamseer et al., 2015). With the assistance of a 
library scientist, we searched for randomized trials indexed from 1980 
to May 11, 2017 in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, MEDLINE 
inprocess, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, 
CINAHL, and PsychINFO. The search strategy included Medical Subject 
Heading terms and text words that identified patients with cancer or 
HSCT recipients who received an intervention to reduce fatigue. Appendix
 A shows the full search strategies.2.1. Study selectionEligibility
 criteria were defined a priori. We included studies if participants of 
any age had cancer or were HSCT recipients, and if the study was a fully
 published primary randomized or quasi-randomized trial with a parallel 
group design. The study had to evaluate an intervention for the 
prevention or treatment of fatigue. We excluded studies if less than 75%
 of participants had cancer or were undergoing HSCT; if fatigue was 
either not an end-point or reported as an adverse effect; if the 
intervention was direct cancer treatment; and if less than five 
participants were randomized to any study arm. We did not restrict 
inclusion by language. For the purpose of this systematic review, we 
then limited studies to those in which non-physical activity mind and 
body practices were the intervention being evaluated.Two 
reviewers (SO, PDR or LS) independently evaluated the titles and 
abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy. Any publication 
considered potentially relevant by any reviewer was retrieved in full 
and assessed for eligibility by two reviewers (SO, PDR or LS). Inclusion
 of studies in this systematic review was determined by agreement of 
both reviewers. Discrepancies between the two reviewers were resolved by
 consensus and adjudication by a third reviewer if required (LLD or LS).
 Agreement in study inclusion between the two reviewers was described 
using the kappa statistic. Strength of agreement was defined as slight 
(0.00â€“0.20), fair (0.21â€“0.40), moderate (0.41â€“0.60), substantial 
(0.61â€“0.80), or almost perfect (0.81â€“1.00) (Koch et al., 1977).2.2. Data abstraction and outcomesData
 were abstracted in duplicate by two reviewers (ND, HD or PDR) and any 
discrepancies were resolved by consensus. If discrepancies could not be 
resolved by consensus, a third reviewer (LS) adjudicated. We contacted 
authors in the event of missing primary outcome data.The 
primary outcome was self-reported fatigue severity across the fatigue 
scales used in the primary studies. For studies that used more than one 
fatigue scale, we selected one scale to be used for analyses based upon 
an a priori developed rule. We selected the most prevalent fatigue scale
 used across studies (see Appendix B).2.3. Categorization of non-physical activity mind and body practice interventions and control groupsThe
 interventions were non-physical activity mind and body practices. 
Practices were classified as: (1) acupuncture and acupressure; (2) 
mindfulness (practice of enhancing awareness of thoughts, emotions, and 
experiences) (Anonymous, 2017a); (3) relaxation techniques (such as 
progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery); (4) massage 
therapies; (5) energy therapies (including Reiki, therapeutic touch, and
 healing touch) (Anonymous, 2017b); (6) energizing yogic breathing; and

Publication bias was estimated to assess
any bias in the included studies. Funnel plots, Orwin and classic fail-safe N
tests [21], Begg and Mazumdar Rank correlation tests [22], the Harbord-Eggerâ€™s
test of the intercept [23] and Duval and Tweedieâ€™s trim and fill method [24]
calculations were used. Funnel plots for each, study
effect size about their sample size were constructed with scattered plots,
where a lack of skew or asymmetry indicated an absence of publication bias. Both the Orwin fail-safe N test and classic
fail-safe N test were applied to determine studies that are missing from
the systematic review and meta-analysis, even with the advent of complete
online bibliographic searching. These tests help to enumerate the studies in a
meta-analysis which transfers the effect size towards null and also makes it
possible to interpret whether it is true or false [21]. The Begg and Mazumdar rank correlation test
uses the correlation between the ranks of effect sizes and the ranks of their
variances. Inverse correlation may occur between study size and effect size due
to the sizeable prognostic effects in melanoma patients. Therefore, we
estimated the rank order correlation (Kendallâ€™s tau-b) between the prognostic
effect and the standard error (which is driven primarily by sample size).
Positive values indicate a trend towards a higher level of test accuracy in
studies with smaller sample sizes [22]. The Egger regression gives the degree of
funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from a regression of
standard normal which deviates against precision [23]. This test was performed
to determine whether there is an association between test accuracy estimates
(estimate divided by its standard error) and their precision (reciprocal of the
standard error of the estimate). A rank-based method was used to estimate
the number of missing studies from the meta-analysis due to suppression of the
most extreme results on one side of the funnel plot and to produce an adjusted
estimate of test accuracy by inputting suspected missing studies. It initially
trims the asymmetric studies from the right-hand side to locate the unbiased
effect (in an iterative procedure), and then fills the plot by re-inserting the
trimmed studies on the right and their input-ted counterparts to the left of
the mean effect [24].","### D:

This systematic review and meta-analysis
was conducted according to established guidelines.20,21
Study Selection
We conducted a comprehensive search of
Pubmed (1946 to April 2017) and PsycInfo (1597 to April 2017) using terms (see
S-Table 1) related to prenatal, obesity, offspring and neurodevelopment. The
term â€˜neurodevelopmentalâ€™ included ASD, ADHD, cognitive and intellectual delay
and emotional/behavioral problems. We included observational studies
irrespective of publication status, language, sample size, follow-up duration
or BMI classification standard.
Three coders (CES, KR, AM) examined each
articleâ€™s title, abstract, and keywords from the search results. Each coder
worked independently to determine whether an article met inclusion criteria. If
disagreements between coders could not be resolved, the senior author (BFF) was
consulted. If relevant articles were misclassified during the initial coding
process, two other techniques (see below for more detail) were used to help
uncover the reports again. In total, 1483 abstracts were examined âˆ’ 57 (4%)
were deemed to meet inclusion criteria.
Two other types of searches were conducted
on any empirical study report and/or literature review that was determined to
be relevant. We examined reference lists of all reports that met inclusion
criteria to determine whether they cited any potentially relevant article
(backward search). We then conducted a cited reference search to determine
whether the reports that met inclusion criteria had been later cited by any potentially
relevant article (forward search). For backward and forward searches, titles
and abstracts were initially reviewed by the first author (CES), and if deemed
potentially relevant, the full-text was obtained. These search strategies
yielded an additional 6 reports.
To minimize publication bias, we contacted
authors whose articles reported maternal obesity and neurodevelopmental
outcomes but did not provide adjusted or unadjusted ORs, and requested raw data
so that we could calculate unadjusted ORs. For 12 articles (with publication
dates within the past 10 years), we received 4 responses that allowed us to
include the report in the meta-analysis and 2 responses that provided
information to include in the synthesis.
Data Extraction
Numerous characteristics of each study were
retrieved using a standardized data collection form. These characteristics
encompassed six broad domains: (a) the research report included basic
information about authorship and date of publication; (b) study characteristics
included information about the cohort, source of study population, and study
design; (c) quality 
indicators to assess observational studies
(see below); (d) sample information included demographic characteristics of the
cohorts; (e) outcome measures included information pertaining to the
neurodevelopmental outcomes and covariates; and (f) estimate of effect size
detailed the information needed to derive an unadjusted OR or adjusted OR and
95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Data extraction was completed by 4 reviewers
(CB, KR, AS, AM), with each article being independently coded twice. If there
was a discrepancy in coding, the two coders discussed each disagreement until
agreement was reached. If the disagreement could not be resolved, the first
author was consulted. This method results in high effective reliability.22
Quality assessmentâ€”A Quality Assessment
Scale was developed based on Tooth et al.23 and similar to Yu et al.24 (see
S-Table 2). We assessed the quality of all included studies based on 8
indicators: type of study, loss to follow-up, sample size, participant
selection, comparability of groups, statistical methods, criteria for
determining and categorizing pre-pregnancy weight, and measurement of
neurodevelopmental outcome. The quality of each study was classified as high
(>14), medium (11â€“14), or low ( 30 for
obese, reported in kg/m2 metric), although there were some exceptions. Three
articles grouped overweight and obese mothers together28â€“30; thus, these were
analyzed only as a combined obese and overweight category. Other articles
defined pre-pregnancy obesity as >30 BMI and all other participants were
defined as non-obese at","### D:

This systematic review complied with the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines
(Table S1).9 The protocol was prospectively registered in the International
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (registration number:  CRD42018096969). No ethics committee approval
or informed consent was required since this was a retrospective analysis of
previously published studies.
Data Sources and Search Strategy
An extensive, unrestricted, computerized
MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library literature search of articles in English
and French was independently conducted by 2 reviewers (J.A., L.D.) according to
prespeciï¬ed selection criteria from inception to April 3, 2018. We also
considered studies selected from prior meta-analyses related to the impact of
MRAs on AF occurrence6,7; trial protocols on trial registry platforms,
including clinicaltrials.gov ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/), the World Health
Organizationâ€™s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform
( http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/), the UK Clinical Trials Gateway ( https://www.ukctg.nihr.ac.uk/),
and EudraCT ( https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/); and data from scientiï¬c meeting
abstracts and conferences. We used both controlled terms (ie, MeSH terms in
MEDLINE) and free-text terms related to MRAs as domain 1 (details of the search
are provided in Figure 1). Regarding domain 2 (AF domain), as we did not expect
that AF would be reported often in study titles or abstracts (because AF is
often a secondary end point of MRA studies), we did not create a speciï¬c search
domain using the free term â€œAFâ€ to avoid restricting search strategy.
Therefore, we computed a larger domain using the terms â€œcardiovascular diseaseâ€
OR â€œheart diseaseâ€ OR â€œatrial ï¬brillationâ€ (domain 2). The ï¬nal research was
performed as follows: (domain 1) AND (domain 2). Second, a manual search was
performed for relevant references from the selected articles.
Study Selection
Studies evaluating the effects of MRAs
(study intervention) compared with non-MRA drugs (placebo or other control
drugs, study comparator) on AF occurrence in adult patients were included.
Studies using comparators other than drugs were not included. Clinical trials
(randomized or nonrandomized, parallel arm, and cluster designs) and clinical
observational comparative studies (including retrospective or prospective
cohorts and case-control or nested case-control designs) reporting any AF
outcomes and the use of MRAs were included. We excluded cross-sectional
studies, case series, crossover studies, and case reports. Healthcare/health
insurance database studies were also excluded because this type of database
does not offer much valuable clinical information to allow the conduct of
subgroup and meta-regression analyses.
Data Extraction
Two review authors (J.A., L.D.)
independently screened study titles and abstracts identiï¬ed by the search
against eligibility criteria. Full reports were obtained for all eligible
articles/abstracts. The review authors independently extracted data from the
selected studies in duplicate using a standardized data extraction form. Any
disagreements were resolved by consensus with senior authors (J.J.P., P.M.).
The j statistic revealed excellent agreement between the 2 review authors

Literature searchThis study was exempt from institutional review board approval at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine as data were gathered from published literature. The following databases were searched for articles before May 01, 2018: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Global Resource of EczemA Trials, and Web of Science. The search strategy was modiï¬ed from previous reviews of AD21 and extracutaneous infection (Table I).22,23 Inclusion criteria were any retrospective or prospective studies that evaluated the relationship between AD and bacterial infections with a control group and included at least 20 AD patients (children or adults of male or female sex) published online, in print, or in press in any language before May 01, 2018. Title and abstract review were performed by 1 reviewer (Dr Serrano). Studies were excluded on the basis of the title or abstract if there was no clear indication they evaluated the relationship between AD and bacterial infections. The remaining articles progressed to fulltext review and were completely reviewed for inclusion. If data were duplicated in>1 study, the most recent and complete study was included.Data extractionThe following data items, if available, were collected: ï¬rst author; year of publication; study design; geographical region; number of persons with AD, bacterial infections, or both enrolled in the study; AD severity; age range; sex proportion; and AD and infection diagnostic criteria.Study quality assessmentA modiï¬ed version of the NewcastleOttawa Scale was used to assess study quality of crosssectional studies in metaanalysis.24 The scoring system summarized 7 aspects of each study: research design, recruitment strategy, response rate, representativeness of sample, objectivity/reliability of outcome determination, power calculation provided, and appropriate statistical analyses.

well defined, the main outcome [hospital mortality] was objective, andthe
 effect of DAD is likely to be the same in patients with ARDS) and 2) 
the number of studies expected to be included was low. To detect the 
risk of publication bias and the small-study effect, we performed a 
funnel plot analysis by plotting the ORs of individual studies against 
their variance. The asymmetric inverted funnel shape suggested an 
association between pooled estimate and study size (publication or small
 study bias). An Eggerâ€™s test to objectively assess the funnel plot 
asymmetry was also performed.","### D:

the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA)
statement (see Supplementary Table S1) (19).
Search strategy
A comprehensive literature search of PubMed was
conducted between 28 May and 4 June 2018. Three search strings were formulated
related to BMI and obesity (â€œbody mass indexâ€, â€œBMIâ€, â€œobesityâ€, â€œobeseâ€, â€œbody
weightâ€, â€œweight lossâ€, â€œweight gainâ€), ALS (â€œALSâ€, â€œAmyotrophic lateral sclerosisâ€)
and â€œmotor neuron diseaseâ€ (see Supplementary Table S2). No publication date restriction
was imposed. Reference lists of retrieved studies were also searched manually
to identify additional studies.
Eligibility criteria
Articles were included in the meta-analysis if
they satisfied the following criteria: (1) quantitatively comparative design
involving consecutive patients; (2) patients were diagnosed with definite,
probable, probable (laboratory-supported), or possible ALS according to the El
Escorial revised criteria (20), without restrictions on gender, age or other major
patient characteristics; (3) impact of BMI or obesity was analyzed
independently of other comorbidities; (4) the primary outcome was overall survival
(OS), and adequate data were reported to estimate odds ratios (ORs), relative
risks (RRs) and hazard ratios (HRs); and (5) studies were published as
full-text articles in peer-reviewed English-language journals.
Case studies, reviews, preclinical experiments,
conference abstracts and letters were excluded. If studies involved overlapping
study populations, only the most recent study was included.
Data collection
The following data were extracted from included
studies into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet: authors, publication year, country
of origin, study design, study period, sample size, gender composition, age,
BMI cutoff for the definition of obesity, score on the ALS functional rating
scale-revised (ALSFRS-R), length of follow-up, outcome measures and data,
statistical methods, and results of tests. Studies were categorized according
to whether they treated BMI as a continuous variable or dichotomous variable
(obese vs. normal). For the purpose of this meta-analysis and in accordance

The meta-analysis was performed following PRISMA guidelines12.
Search and inclusion criteria
We conducted an electronic search without language restrictions using
MEDLINE/PubMed, the Cochrane library, ISI Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL and
the US National Institutes of Health clinical trials registry
( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). The following search terms were used:
antipsychotic(s); neuroleptic(s); individual names of SGAs; schizophrenia;
random, randomly, randomized; and maintenance, relapse, discontinuation or
long-term. The last search was done on October 29, 2018. The electronic search
was supplemented by a hand search of reference lists of relevant studies and
reviews. Authors and companies were contacted to provide missing information
and unpublished data.
We included randomized, head-to-head comparisons of oral SGAs in adults with
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder which reported on treatment
discontinuation, whether randomization occurred during the acute or maintenance
phase. As we aimed to focus on the comparative long-term effectiveness of SGAs,
we only included head-to-head studies lasting â‰¥6 months.
We excluded studies with >20% of non-schizophrenia/schizoaffective
disorder patients. As long-acting injectable formulation enhances the adherence
and therefore has a significant impact on long-term outcome13, 14, we excluded
studies on long-acting antipsychotics.
The search, selection of the literature, and data extraction were conducted
independently by â‰¥2 reviewers (KH, MN, TK, CC). Disagreements were resolved by
consensus.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was all-cause discontinuation at study endpoint.
Secondary outcomes included: a) psychopathology score change, measured by
the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Brief Psychiatric Rating
Scale (BPRS) or the Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) score (mixed
models or last-observation-carried-forward was prioritized over observed cases
analysis); b) inefficacy-related discontinuation (as reported by the original
study authors); c) intolerability-related discontinuation (as reported by the
original study authors); d) relapse (as reported by the original study
authors); e) hospitalization; f) remission (as reported by the original study
authors); g) functioning score; h) quality of life (QOL); and i) adverse
events.
Adverse events included: weight gain (as change from baseline or proportion
of patients with clinically significant increase); prolactin increase (as
change from baseline or proportion of patients with hyperprolactinemia);
neuromotor adverse effects, including parkinsonism assessed with the Simpson-Angus
Rating Scale or use of anticholinergics, akathisia and dyskinesia; and sedation
and/or somnolence.
Data analysis
SGAs were compared individually for each outcome. We applied a

To identify eligible studies, systematic
searches of all glomus jugulare tumors treated with radiosurgery were conducted
in the PubMed, SCOPUS, and EMBASE databases using the keywords â€œglomus
jugulare,â€ â€œradiosurgery,â€ â€œgamma knife,â€ â€œLINACâ€ (linear accelerator), and
â€œCyberKnife.â€ No limits were set on the date of publication or the duration of
follow-up.
The studies were determined eligible for
inclusion if they were original research studies that reported the results of
radiosurgery for glomus jugulare tumors. Reviews were excluded. If an
institution or consortium had published multiple studies, only the report with
the largest sample size was included for analysis. Using this method, 47
studies were initially identified (Fig. 1) 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34,

pool, 20 reviews or off-topic studies were excluded. Of the remaining 27
studies, 8 were excluded because their results had been reported in other
reports.
The data search yielded 19 studies that were
included in the meta-analysis (Table 1).
Of these, 14 studies used gamma knife (GK) therapy and 5 used linear
accelerator-based radiosurgery (LINAC) or Cyberknife (CK). Data on 335 glomus
jugulare patients were extracted, including 278 who had received GK and 57 who
had received LINAC or CK. Of the 19 studies, 10 had a mean or median follow-up
time >36 months.
The included studies varied considerably in
both their appraisal of the data and what data was presented in the results. To
standardize the results, the patients were considered to exhibit tumor control
if the follow-up radiographic analysis revealed that the glomus jugulare tumor
volume was equal to or less than the glomus jugulare tumor volume at
radiosurgery. Similarly, a patient was considered to have achieved clinical
control if the study investigator determined the patient's clinical condition
to be improved or unchanged at a follow-up examination compared with the
patient's condition at radiosurgery. A wide variance in the manner and detail
of reporting acute complications and long-term sequelae across the 19 studies
prevented statistical analysis of these features, but the available information
from these studies is provided (Table 2).
The meta-analysis was performed by transforming
proportions into the Freeman-Tukey variant of the arcsine square
root-transformed proportions (52). The pooled proportion was calculated by back
transforming the weighted mean of the transformed proportions. The degree of
combinability of the studies was assessed by estimating the Cochrane's
statistic and inconsistency (I2) statistic. Fixed effects pooled proportions
were calculated from the data when Cochrane's statistic was statistically
insignificant and the inconsistency among the studies (I2) was","### D:

assess whether the addition of joinpoints resulted in statistically 
significant linear changes in the direction or magnitude of the rates in

The parameter estimate used to summarize the trend over the fixed 
interval was the average annual percentage change (AAPC) according to a 
generalized log-linear model that assumed a Poisson distribution.

For the conduct of this systematic review, we followed the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses 
(PRISMA) statement (Shamseer et al., 2015). With the assistance of a 
library scientist, we searched for randomized trials indexed from 1980 
to May 11, 2017 in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, MEDLINE 
inprocess, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, 
CINAHL, and PsychINFO. The search strategy included Medical Subject 
Heading terms and text words that identified patients with cancer or 
HSCT recipients who received an intervention to reduce fatigue. Appendix
 A shows the full search strategies.2.1. Study selectionEligibility
 criteria were defined a priori. We included studies if participants of 
any age had cancer or were HSCT recipients, and if the study was a fully
 published primary randomized or quasi-randomized trial with a parallel 
group design. The study had to evaluate an intervention for the 
prevention or treatment of fatigue. We excluded studies if less than 75%
 of participants had cancer or were undergoing HSCT; if fatigue was 
either not an end-point or reported as an adverse effect; if the 
intervention was direct cancer treatment; and if less than five 
participants were randomized to any study arm. We did not restrict 
inclusion by language. For the purpose of this systematic review, we 
then limited studies to those in which non-physical activity mind and 
body practices were the intervention being evaluated.Two 
reviewers (SO, PDR or LS) independently evaluated the titles and 
abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy. Any publication 
considered potentially relevant by any reviewer was retrieved in full 
and assessed for eligibility by two reviewers (SO, PDR or LS). Inclusion
 of studies in this systematic review was determined by agreement of 
both reviewers. Discrepancies between the two reviewers were resolved by
 consensus and adjudication by a third reviewer if required (LLD or LS).
 Agreement in study inclusion between the two reviewers was described 
using the kappa statistic. Strength of agreement was defined as slight 
(0.00â€“0.20), fair (0.21â€“0.40), moderate (0.41â€“0.60), substantial 
(0.61â€“0.80), or almost perfect (0.81â€“1.00) (Koch et al., 1977).2.2. Data abstraction and outcomesData
 were abstracted in duplicate by two reviewers (ND, HD or PDR) and any 
discrepancies were resolved by consensus. If discrepancies could not be 
resolved by consensus, a third reviewer (LS) adjudicated. We contacted 
authors in the event of missing primary outcome data.The 
primary outcome was self-reported fatigue severity across the fatigue 
scales used in the primary studies. For studies that used more than one 
fatigue scale, we selected one scale to be used for analyses based upon 
an a priori developed rule. We selected the most prevalent fatigue scale
 used across studies (see Appendix B).2.3. Categorization of non-physical activity mind and body practice interventions and control groupsThe
 interventions were non-physical activity mind and body practices. 
Practices were classified as: (1) acupuncture and acupressure; (2) 
mindfulness (practice of enhancing awareness of thoughts, emotions, and 
experiences) (Anonymous, 2017a); (3) relaxation techniques (such as 
progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery); (4) massage 
therapies; (5) energy therapies (including Reiki, therapeutic touch, and
 healing touch) (Anonymous, 2017b); (6) energizing yogic breathing; and 
(7) others. We categorized the duration of the intervention based upon 
the median duration of all interventions as","### E:

This systematic review and meta-analysis
was conducted according to established guidelines.20,21
Study Selection
We conducted a comprehensive search of
Pubmed (1946 to April 2017) and PsycInfo (1597 to April 2017) using terms (see
S-Table 1) related to prenatal, obesity, offspring and neurodevelopment. The
term â€˜neurodevelopmentalâ€™ included ASD, ADHD, cognitive and intellectual delay
and emotional/behavioral problems. We included observational studies
irrespective of publication status, language, sample size, follow-up duration
or BMI classification standard.
Three coders (CES, KR, AM) examined each
articleâ€™s title, abstract, and keywords from the search results. Each coder
worked independently to determine whether an article met inclusion criteria. If
disagreements between coders could not be resolved, the senior author (BFF) was
consulted. If relevant articles were misclassified during the initial coding
process, two other techniques (see below for more detail) were used to help
uncover the reports again. In total, 1483 abstracts were examined âˆ’ 57 (4%)
were deemed to meet inclusion criteria.
Two other types of searches were conducted
on any empirical study report and/or literature review that was determined to
be relevant. We examined reference lists of all reports that met inclusion
criteria to determine whether they cited any potentially relevant article
(backward search). We then conducted a cited reference search to determine
whether the reports that met inclusion criteria had been later cited by any potentially
relevant article (forward search). For backward and forward searches, titles
and abstracts were initially reviewed by the first author (CES), and if deemed
potentially relevant, the full-text was obtained. These search strategies
yielded an additional 6 reports.
To minimize publication bias, we contacted
authors whose articles reported maternal obesity and neurodevelopmental
outcomes but did not provide adjusted or unadjusted ORs, and requested raw data
so that we could calculate unadjusted ORs. For 12 articles (with publication
dates within the past 10 years), we received 4 responses that allowed us to
include the report in the meta-analysis and 2 responses that provided
information to include in the synthesis.
Data Extraction
Numerous characteristics of each study were
retrieved using a standardized data collection form. These characteristics
encompassed six broad domains: (a) the research report included basic
information about authorship and date of publication; (b) study characteristics
included information about the cohort, source of study population, and study
design; (c) quality indicators to assess observational studies
(see below); (d) sample information included demographic characteristics of the
cohorts; (e) outcome measures included information pertaining to the
neurodevelopmental outcomes and covariates; and (f) estimate of effect size
detailed the information needed to derive an unadjusted OR or adjusted OR and
95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Data extraction was completed by 4 reviewers
(CB, KR, AS, AM), with each article being independently coded twice. If there
was a discrepancy in coding, the two coders discussed each disagreement until
agreement was reached. If the disagreement could not be resolved, the first
author was consulted. This method results in high effective reliability.22
Quality assessmentâ€”A Quality Assessment
Scale was developed based on Tooth et al.23 and similar to Yu et al.24 (see
S-Table 2). We assessed the quality of all included studies based on 8
indicators: type of study, loss to follow-up, sample size, participant
selection, comparability of groups, statistical methods, criteria for
determining and categorizing pre-pregnancy weight, and measurement of
neurodevelopmental outcome. The quality of each study was classified as high
(>14), medium (11â€“14), or low ( 30 for
obese, reported in kg/m2 metric), although there were some exceptions. Three
articles grouped overweight and obese mothers together28â€“30; thus, these were
analyzed only as a combined obese and overweight category. Other articles
defined pre-pregnancy obesity as >30 BMI and all other participants were
defined as non-obese at","### E:

Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (registration number:  CRD42018096969). No ethics committee approval
or informed consent was required since this was a retrospective analysis of
previously published studies.
Data Sources and Search Strategy
An extensive, unrestricted, computerized
MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library literature search of articles in English
and French was independently conducted by 2 reviewers (J.A., L.D.) according to
prespeciï¬ed selection criteria from inception to April 3, 2018. We also
considered studies selected from prior meta-analyses related to the impact of
MRAs on AF occurrence6,7; trial protocols on trial registry platforms,
including clinicaltrials.gov ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/), the World Health
Organizationâ€™s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform
( http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/), the UK Clinical Trials Gateway ( https://www.ukctg.nihr.ac.uk/),
and EudraCT ( https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/); and data from scientiï¬c meeting
abstracts and conferences. We used both controlled terms (ie, MeSH terms in
MEDLINE) and free-text terms related to MRAs as domain 1 (details of the search
are provided in Figure 1). Regarding domain 2 (AF domain), as we did not expect
that AF would be reported often in study titles or abstracts (because AF is
often a secondary end point of MRA studies), we did not create a speciï¬c search
domain using the free term â€œAFâ€ to avoid restricting search strategy.
Therefore, we computed a larger domain using the terms â€œcardiovascular diseaseâ€
OR â€œheart diseaseâ€ OR â€œatrial ï¬brillationâ€ (domain 2). The ï¬nal research was
performed as follows: (domain 1) AND (domain 2). Second, a manual search was
performed for relevant references from the selected articles.
Study Selection
Studies evaluating the effects of MRAs
(study intervention) compared with non-MRA drugs (placebo or other control
drugs, study comparator) on AF occurrence in adult patients were included.
Studies using comparators other than drugs were not included. Clinical trials
(randomized or nonrandomized, parallel arm, and cluster designs) and clinical
observational comparative studies (including retrospective or prospective
cohorts and case-control or nested case-control designs) reporting any AF
outcomes and the use of MRAs were included. We excluded cross-sectional
studies, case series, crossover studies, and case reports. Healthcare/health
insurance database studies were also excluded because this type of database
does not offer much valuable clinical information to allow the conduct of
subgroup and meta-regression analyses.
Data Extraction
Two review authors (J.A., L.D.)
independently screened study titles and abstracts identiï¬ed by the search
against eligibility criteria. Full reports were obtained for all eligible
articles/abstracts. The review authors independently extracted data from the
selected studies in duplicate using a standardized data extraction form. Any
disagreements were resolved by consensus with senior authors (J.J.P., P.M.).

To compare differences between categorical
outcomes between PCC and FFP, we generated pooled odd ratios (ORs) with
corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) using a Mantel-Haenszel
random-effects model (21). Pooled results of continuous outcomes were
summarised using mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95 % CI. Heterogeneity
was classified based on a scale of I2: contributory (I2 = 0â€“30 %), moderate
(I2= 30â€“50 %), substantial (I2= 50â€“75 %) and considerable (I2 > 75 %) (21).
A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all
tests. Absolute risk reduction (ARR) and number needed to treat were
calculated. 
 We performed a priori subgroup analysis
according to indication for warfarin reversal (major bleeding or urgent surgery
or invasive procedure) and type of PCC (3F- and 4F-PCC). Sensitivity analyses

Search strategyWe searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to December 2015 using a sensitive search strategy combining the following Medical Subject Headings (MESHs) and keywords: haemorrhage, bleed, invasive procedure, surgery, general surgery, surg*, emergencies, procedure, warfarin, acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, vit-amin K antagonist, blood component transfusion, plasma, fresh frozen plasma, blood coagulation factors, coagulants, prothrombin complex concentrate, prothrombin, factor X, factor IX, factor VII, factor II, beriplex, kcentra, confidex, octaplex and profilnine. A manual review of reference lists was also conducted. Potential sources of unpublished data were searched through www.clinical trials.gov up to December 2015.The methods and outcomes were reported according to PRISMA recommendations (18). The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO Trial Registration (#CRD42015017383).Study selectionTwo reviewers (CC and CH) independently performed study selection using pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies (prospective or retrospective) were eligible, with no language restriction. We included studies that investigated adult patients (aged 18 years or older) who presented with warfarin associated major bleeding, or those who required urgent warfarin reversal for surgery or an invasive procedure. We selected only studies comparing PCC (either 3F- or 4F-PCC) to FFP. Studies that evaluated a combination of PCCs and FFP or factor VIIa as a co-intervention were excluded. If the same patients were used in multiple studies, we chose the study with the largest sample size or most complete out-come report. Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved by consensus or a third reviewer (MC).Data extractionData were extracted independently by two reviewers (CC and CH) using a standardised data record form. The following information was extracted and recorded: first author, year of publication, inclusion criteria, study design, mean or median age of participants, sex, indications for anticoagulant therapy, bleeding site, type of surgery (procedure), type and dose of PCC, dose of FFP and du-ration of follow-up. Discrepancies between the reviewers resolved by consensus or a third reviewer (MC).OutcomesThe primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30 days. We chose the 30-day period because this reflects the efficacy and safety of re-versal agents during bleeding and surgical events. Delayed deaths beyond this point are more likely to be associated with causes un-related to warfarin reversal treatment choice. The secondary out-comes were volume overload, thromboembolic events, haemostasis, speed of INR reduction, proportion of patients who achieved INR correction and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion.Risk of bias assessmentThe methodological quality of the randomized studies was evaluated independently by two reviewers (CC and RM) using the Cochrane Collaborationâ€™s Risk of Bias tool (19), scoring each study for: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, method of blinding, completeness of data, selective outcome reporting and other risks of bias. Each parameter was judged as a high, low or unclear risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or through a third reviewer (MC).The quality of the observational studies was assessed using A Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool: for Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ACROBAT-NRSI) (20). We evaluated the risk of bias based on confounding, selection of participants, measurement of the interventions, departures from intended intervention, missing data, measurement of outcomes and selection of the reported results. Each outcome was judged as a low, moderate, serious, critical and no information.We generated funnel plots of effect size versus standard error of effect estimates in order to assess for potential publication bias. Publication bias was considered to be present if the funnel plots were asymmetrical.Data synthesisTo compare differences between categorical outcomes between PCC and FFP, we generated pooled odd ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) using a Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model (21). Pooled results of continuous outcomes were summarised using mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95 % CI. Heterogeneity was classified based on a scale of I2: contributory (I2 = 0â€“30 %), moderate (I2= 30â€“50 %), substantial (I2= 50â€“75 %) and considerable (I2 > 75 %) (21). A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all tests. Absolute risk reduction (ARR) and number needed to treat were calculated.We performed a priori subgroup analysis according to indication for warfarin reversal (major bleeding or urgent surgery or invasive procedure) and type of PCC (3F- and 4F-PCC). Sensitivity analyses were carried out for study design (randomised controlled studies or observational studies). We reanalysed the data when removing study with high risk of bias. In addition, all analyses were repeated with fixed-effect modelling.The main analysis was performed using Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.3 (Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014).Trial sequential analysisTo address possible Type I (random) error and ensure adequate meta-analysis information size (22, 23), we constructed a trial sequential analysis for the three clinically relevant outcomes (all-cause mortality, congestive heart failure/volume overload and thromboembolic events). We calculated the required information size (meta-analysis sample size) for the primary out-come based on an assumption of a plausible reduction in the relative risk of all-cause mortality from the pooled estimates (30 %) when the patients received PCC as compared with FFP given a baseline mortality rate of 13 % (1), type I error of 5 % and type II error of 20 %. For this analysis, the trial sequential monitoring boundaries for benefit and harm were constructed. We used TSA software version 0.9 beta (available on http://ww.ctu.dk/tsa/).Assessment of the quality of the evidences across studiesWe assessed the quality of the body of evidence from the included studies using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) tool (24). The quality of the evidence for all outcomes was judged as very low, low, moderate or high based on the following domains; risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias (25). The summary of findings table was constructed using GRADEpro (McMaster University 2014, available on www. gradepro.org).",False,1.0,1.0,True

Search strategy
A comprehensive literature search of PubMed was
conducted between 28 May and 4 June 2018. Three search strings were formulated
related to BMI and obesity (â€œbody mass indexâ€, â€œBMIâ€, â€œobesityâ€, â€œobeseâ€, â€œbody
weightâ€, â€œweight lossâ€, â€œweight gainâ€), ALS (â€œALSâ€, â€œAmyotrophic lateral sclerosisâ€)
and â€œmotor neuron diseaseâ€ (see Supplementary Table S2). No publication date restriction
was imposed. Reference lists of retrieved studies were also searched manually
to identify additional studies.
Eligibility criteria
Articles were included in the meta-analysis if
they satisfied the following criteria: (1) quantitatively comparative design
involving consecutive patients; (2) patients were diagnosed with definite,
probable, probable (laboratory-supported), or possible ALS according to the El
Escorial revised criteria (20), without restrictions on gender, age or other major
patient characteristics; (3) impact of BMI or obesity was analyzed
independently of other comorbidities; (4) the primary outcome was overall survival
(OS), and adequate data were reported to estimate odds ratios (ORs), relative
risks (RRs) and hazard ratios (HRs); and (5) studies were published as
full-text articles in peer-reviewed English-language journals.
Case studies, reviews, preclinical experiments,
conference abstracts and letters were excluded. If studies involved overlapping
study populations, only the most recent study was included.
Data collection
The following data were extracted from included
studies into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet: authors, publication year, country
of origin, study design, study period, sample size, gender composition, age,
BMI cutoff for the definition of obesity, score on the ALS functional rating
scale-revised (ALSFRS-R), length of follow-up, outcome measures and data,
statistical methods, and results of tests. Studies were categorized according
to whether they treated BMI as a continuous variable or dichotomous variable
(obese vs. normal). For the purpose of this meta-analysis and in accordance
with definitions of the World Health Organization, BMI (kg/m2 )","### E:

The meta-analysis was performed following PRISMA guidelines12.
Search and inclusion criteria
We conducted an electronic search without language restrictions using
MEDLINE/PubMed, the Cochrane library, ISI Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL and
the US National Institutes of Health clinical trials registry
( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). The following search terms were used:
antipsychotic(s); neuroleptic(s); individual names of SGAs; schizophrenia;
random, randomly, randomized; and maintenance, relapse, discontinuation or
long-term. The last search was done on October 29, 2018. The electronic search
was supplemented by a hand search of reference lists of relevant studies and
reviews. Authors and companies were contacted to provide missing information
and unpublished data.
We included randomized, head-to-head comparisons of oral SGAs in adults with
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder which reported on treatment
discontinuation, whether randomization occurred during the acute or maintenance
phase. As we aimed to focus on the comparative long-term effectiveness of SGAs,
we only included head-to-head studies lasting â‰¥6 months.
We excluded studies with >20% of non-schizophrenia/schizoaffective
disorder patients. As long-acting injectable formulation enhances the adherence
and therefore has a significant impact on long-term outcome13, 14, we excluded
studies on long-acting antipsychotics.
The search, selection of the literature, and data extraction were conducted
independently by â‰¥2 reviewers (KH, MN, TK, CC). Disagreements were resolved by
consensus.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was all-cause discontinuation at study endpoint.
Secondary outcomes included: a) psychopathology score change, measured by
the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Brief Psychiatric Rating
Scale (BPRS) or the Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) score (mixed
models or last-observation-carried-forward was prioritized over observed cases
analysis); b) inefficacy-related discontinuation (as reported by the original
study authors); c) intolerability-related discontinuation (as reported by the
original study authors); d) relapse (as reported by the original study
authors); e) hospitalization; f) remission (as reported by the original study
authors); g) functioning score; h) quality of life (QOL); and i) adverse
events.
Adverse events included: weight gain (as change from baseline or proportion
of patients with clinically significant increase); prolactin increase (as
change from baseline or proportion of patients with hyperprolactinemia);
neuromotor adverse effects, including parkinsonism assessed with the Simpson-Angus
Rating Scale or use of anticholinergics, akathisia and dyskinesia; and sedation
and/or somnolence.
Data analysis
SGAs were compared individually for each outcome. We applied a
â€œonce-randomized-analyzedâ€ intent-to-treat (ITT) endpoint analysis. In studies
that followed patients even after they were switched off the originally
allocated medication during the study period, we analyzed the primary outcome
based only on the first medication but, for secondary outcomes, we extracted
and analyzed the data as reported in the ITT sample.
Pooled risk ratio (RR) and standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models15. RR
values 1 indicate
superiority for the only positive outcome, remission. For simplicity we
adjusted effect sizes, so that SMDs","### E:

Models in which additional independent variables
were included were also examined. The interaction between these variables and treatment and time (or
simply treatment in the second basic model) was focused on, as well as the
treatment contrasts at each level of the added variable. Methodologic quality
score (entered as a quantitative variable) was examined as a covariate in the
two basic models. To assess for age effects on treatment outcomes, mean
participant age (range 60â€“73) was entered as a covariate in both models. To augment the analysis of mean age described
above, an analysis was also performed limited to the studies that reported data
specific to older age groups (â‰¥65) comparing outcomes for older and younger age
groups.","### E:
